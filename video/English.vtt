00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:19.264
Good Lord, look at you.
Well, get on in here.

2
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.311
How you been, Grandma?

3
00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:26.647
Well, I'm living.

4
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.316
I thought you were coming in earlier.

5
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.610
Well, bus was late.

6
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:36.490
I would've picked you up in town,
only they won't let me drive no more.

7
00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.118
I straightened up your room.

8
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.871
Put some things in the closet.

9
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.582
You go on. Go get settled.

10
00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.792
Okay.

11
00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.182
Yeah.

12
00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:13.944
Yeah, you got this lookin' good, huh?

13
00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.322
Son of a bitch. Goddamn it.

14
00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:19.491
-Hey, Shelly. Shell, Shell, Shell.
-Yeah?

15
00:03:20.284 --> 00:03:21.910
You take my fucking wallet again?

16
00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:26.248
Yeah, I stole it.
There was so much money in it.

17
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.336
I'll be back in, I don't know,
a couple days.

18
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.880
Can't wait.

19
00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:37.593
That woman is nothing but trouble.

20
00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:41.972
If it wasn't for her little boy,
I'd kick her right out of that trailer.

21
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:45.434
I imagine it's gonna take
some time getting used to.

22
00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:46.935
Yeah.

23
00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:50.147
You just gotta get yourself
back out there.

24
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.481
That's all.

25
00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:54.026
You can't be feeling sorry for yourself.

26
00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:55.569
No, ma'am.

27
00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:59.781
And I go to church every Sunday.

28
00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:02.451
If you're living here, you will too.

29
00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:20.469
You know the conditions
of your parole, right?

30
00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:21.637
Yes, sir.

31
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.055
You'll submit to drug testing.

32
00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.973
You'll come in every two weeks,
right here.

33
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:30.020
You are to obey all laws:
municipal, parish, state, federal.

34
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.355
And you'll get a job.

35
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:33.482
Sound good?

36
00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.319
Any idea where you gonna work?

37
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.780
No. See what's out there.

38
00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:42.157
Then I'll see you in a couple weeks.

39
00:04:46.662 --> 00:04:47.955
I'll tell you what.

40
00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.832
I'll give you a call if something
opens up, try to help you out.

41
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.001
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

42
00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:23.448
-Palmer?
-When the fuck did you get out, man?

43
00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:26.034
Holy shit!

44
00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:28.245
Thought you weren't getting out
for five more years, man.

45
00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.539
-I didn't know you could grow a beard.
-All right.

46
00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.499
Hey, you should've told me
you was coming home.

47
00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:34.293
I'd have throwed you a goddamn party.

48
00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.628
-Oh, yeah? Who'd have shown up?
-Dumbass Ned.

49
00:05:36.712 --> 00:05:38.463
-Of course I would've.
-See?

50
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:40.132
The last time I talked to you,

51
00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.968
I threw that money at your commissary
like you was asking,

52
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.637
-but, you know, I never heard from you.
-Thank you, man.

53
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:47.014
You still on that second marriage?

54
00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.765
Hey, don't even get me started.

55
00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.768
I don't know what I was thinking.
And now I got a eight-year-old,

56
00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.438
and Darleen's still kicking me in the nuts
every chance she gets.

57
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.774
-How's little Jake doing?
-Little Jake is 15 years old, man.

58
00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.359
-Fifteen?
-Fifteen.

59
00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:01.528
-Jesus.
-Yep. He's a hell of a ballplayer too.

60
00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:02.613
-Yeah, man.
-Is he now?

61
00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.281
-Just like his daddy.
-I'll bet.

62
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.326
Hey, you know, your TD record
only just got broke a couple years ago.

63
00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.036
-No shit?
-Some little freshman kid.

64
00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.705
-Freshman?
-Holy cow.

65
00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:14.958
Look who it is. Palmer.

66
00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:17.794
-When'd you get out?
-A few days ago.

67
00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.463
Wow.

68
00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:20.631
Looks good on you.

69
00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:23.634
Oh, yeah. Well, you know my daddy.
It's not like I had a choice.

70
00:06:24.927 --> 00:06:26.094
It's good to see you.

71
00:06:26.178 --> 00:06:27.304
Yeah, you too.

72
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.641
-You staying down there at Vivian's place?
-Yeah, for now.

73
00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.101
If you need anything,
you let me know, all right?

74
00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:34.978
I mean that. Anything.

75
00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:38.607
Shit. I need your old man to quit writing
me all these goddamn speeding tickets.

76
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.067
-I don't wanna hear it.
-Let's play some pool.

77
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.027
Hey, Ned, let's get a game in
before the wife calls.

78
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.071
Palmer, you're next.

79
00:06:45.656 --> 00:06:46.907
There you go.

80
00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:48.951
Appreciate you.

81
00:06:49.952 --> 00:06:53.789
-Cosimo, how's it hanging?
-And what do you want?

82
00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.750
I want my nails done and my ass waxed.

83
00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:58.377
What do you think I want?

84
00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:02.422
Get me a Jim and Coke.

85
00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:16.061
You're Vivian's grandson, ain't you?

86
00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:21.859
What's the matter, handsome?

87
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.529
You don't talk?

88
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:39.543
You really did just get outta prison.

89
00:08:50.072 --> 00:08:52.199
Eddie. Eddie, wake up.

90
00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:54.284
We're gonna be late for church.

91
00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:02.167
This boy's gonna make us late, I swear.

92
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.386
Church starts at 10:00 a.m.
Now don't go making us late.

93
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:13.595
Sorry.

94
00:09:31.697 --> 00:09:35.075
Sam, this is my grandson, Eddie.

95
00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:40.747
Now, he would prefer you call him Palmer,
even though Eddie's a much nicer name.

96
00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.128
You had a sleepover with my mama,

97
00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:49.631
and you didn't wear no pajamas
or underwear neither.

98
00:09:49.715 --> 00:09:50.716
Sam.

99
00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:53.385
Roll that window up.

100
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:56.346
It took me two hours to do my hair.

101
00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.238
Dot, you remember Eddie?

102
00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:15.866
Eddie, this is Dot.

103
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.951
My grandson.

104
00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:23.040
-Stop.
-Toby, get off him.

105
00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.250
Good morning, everybody.
I'd like to welcome you

106
00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:26.668
to Wesley Chapel this morning.

107
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.964
Must be strange being back here, huh?

108
00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:32.633
You ain't kidding.

109
00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:37.179
Well, not much has changed.
Still all about church and football.

110
00:10:37.763 --> 00:10:40.557
-Amen.
-They did open a new coffee shop though.

111
00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:44.228
-Eddie.
-Chief.

112
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.105
-Heard you got out early.
-Yes, sir.

113
00:10:47.773 --> 00:10:50.692
Well, you make sure
to keep yourself in check.

114
00:10:50.776 --> 00:10:52.986
I would hate
to have to put you back inside.

115
00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:55.739
Yes, sir.

116
00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.160
-See you down at the station.
-Yeah, Dad.

117
00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:02.162
Shit. Sorry about that.

118
00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:03.413
Same old fart.

119
00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.791
Yeah, I'd be surprised
if he hadn't come over.

120
00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:10.128
Look, I just wanted to say
that I should've came and visited you

121
00:11:10.212 --> 00:11:12.130
or sent you a letter at least.

122
00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:14.258
I should've been a better friend.

123
00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.093
Forget it.

124
00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.095
-What's going on?
-Hey.

125
00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.638
Same shit, different Sunday.

126
00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:23.684
Christ. There's something
seriously wrong with that kid.

127
00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:37.573
Here now. Give this to your mother.

128
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.368
Make sure she eats some.
And it'll keep for a week.

129
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.288
-Thanks, Miss Vivian.
-Sweet boy.

130
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:45.998
-Bye, Miss Vivian.
-Bye-bye.

131
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:47.833
Bye, Palmer.

132
00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:57.259
Good night, Grandma.

133
00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:00.804
Sweet dreams, Eddie. I'm glad you're back.

134
00:12:02.598 --> 00:12:03.599
Me too.

135
00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:34.046
-You slept late.
-Yeah. Guess I did.

136
00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.715
I need some things from the market

137
00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:39.593
if you don't mind picking them up
on the way home.

138
00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:41.803
Yeah, sure.

139
00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:44.765
And hold on. Let me give you some money.

140
00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:48.060
I don't imagine you have any.

141
00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:50.771
Yeah.

142
00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:52.981
Be careful out there.

143
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.900
I'll be back later.

144
00:12:55.526 --> 00:12:57.444
Hey, I ain't kidding. You need to shave,

145
00:12:57.528 --> 00:12:59.780
'cause you give me rug burn down here
and it really hurts.

146
00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:02.699
I'll shave for you, 'cause God knows
I love you, and I love your strawberry.

147
00:13:02.783 --> 00:13:06.119
-Who's that guy over there?
-Tell me again how much you love me.

148
00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.081
Whatever.

149
00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:11.917
He's just looking.

150
00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:18.590
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Have a nice day.

151
00:13:18.674 --> 00:13:21.051
-Hello.
-Hello.

152
00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:27.057
Would you like an application?

153
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.225
Yeah, sure.

154
00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:32.312
I filled that position this morning.

155
00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:34.773
-Hey, Eddie. How you been?
-Hogan.

156
00:13:34.857 --> 00:13:36.859
Just forgot to take the sign down is all.

157
00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.319
Good to see you.

158
00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:41.029
You too.

159
00:13:43.532 --> 00:13:47.286
I'm sorry.
I thought that they were still hiring.

160
00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:50.455
It's fine.

161
00:13:50.956 --> 00:13:52.374
What side do you want?

162
00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:53.959
This side.

163
00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:57.171
I think I can spice that up a little.

164
00:13:57.254 --> 00:13:58.338
That's good.

165
00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:04.845
His mama took off again.

166
00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:07.264
He'll be staying with us till she's back.

167
00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:12.394
I think I need a little color.

168
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:15.105
On the way.

169
00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:17.941
Thank you.

170
00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:23.238
You're gonna have to sleep
out here on the couch.

171
00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:25.324
Sam gets your bed at night.

172
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:29.286
I don't mind the couch, Miss Vivian.
I sleep on it at home.

173
00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:32.873
A boy your age needs to sleep on a bed.

174
00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:33.957
I don't mind.

175
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:35.167
I can watch TV.

176
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.171
Now, too much TV ain't good for you.

177
00:14:40.464 --> 00:14:42.883
Excuse me. Just want these.

178
00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:47.471
My friend Emily gave me this.

179
00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:52.392
Every time she gets a new doll,
I get one of her old ones.

180
00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:54.269
Fuck.

181
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.232
Her dog chewed this one up,
but it's still okay.

182
00:14:58.315 --> 00:15:00.526
She just has to hop a little. See?

183
00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:03.654
You know you're a boy, right?

184
00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:06.073
Yeah.

185
00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.450
Boys don't play with dolls.

186
00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:12.037
Well, I'm a boy, and I do.

187
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.539
Dinner's ready!

188
00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:16.083
See you later, Palmer.

189
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.504
-Meatballs.
-Thank you.

190
00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.968
Did you have any luck finding a job?

191
00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.136
Not yet.

192
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.181
-I'm sure you will.
-Miss Vivian.

193
00:15:34.518 --> 00:15:38.146
-That's for her.
-We love our meatballs.

194
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:44.027
One for you, and one for me.

195
00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:49.032
How long does your mama
usually stay gone for?

196
00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:50.868
You hush now.

197
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.788
When you gonna give me
the rest of the change from the mart?

198
00:15:56.665 --> 00:15:59.334
-I gave it to you.
-Nah, I was short.

199
00:16:00.002 --> 00:16:01.170
What you mean "short"?

200
00:16:01.253 --> 00:16:03.672
I didn't get all my change.

201
00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.512
-Count it.
-I don't need to count it.

202
00:16:10.596 --> 00:16:11.638
It was short.

203
00:16:11.722 --> 00:16:15.017
Twelve dollars and 13 cents.
Go ahead. Count it.

204
00:16:16.852 --> 00:16:18.478
You eat your supper.

205
00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:55.516
Door's open.

206
00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:03.106
I'm Eddie Palmer.
I'm here for my interview.

207
00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:04.983
Come on in.

208
00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:07.736
Calvin Sibs. Have a seat.

209
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:14.242
Fill this out, and we'll take
a walk over to see Principal Forbes.

210
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:20.207
Mr. Palmer, I'm sorry, but I can't
hire you simply due to the fact that

211
00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:22.290
you're a convicted felon.

212
00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:25.671
I understand, sir.

213
00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:29.049
But I did my time, and I did it
without getting in any trouble.

214
00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:30.968
Well, that may be the case,

215
00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.720
but I have the safety of the children
I have to consider.

216
00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:36.640
I ain't never done nothing to no kids.

217
00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.310
If I can't get a job sweeping floors,

218
00:17:40.394 --> 00:17:43.063
then y'all tell me,
what am I supposed to do?

219
00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:46.149
Mr. Sibs, your thoughts?

220
00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:52.447
He's got the experience:
twelve years of laundry, kitchen and yard.

221
00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:54.992
But it's your call.

222
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.209
You were All-USA player
two years in a row at Riverside?

223
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:05.794
Yes, sir.

224
00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:07.754
Football scholarship to LSU?

225
00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.091
Palmer.

226
00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:13.260
You related to Vivian Palmer?

227
00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.220
Yes, sir. That's my grandmother.

228
00:18:15.846 --> 00:18:19.558
Well, she's a respectable member
of our congregation.

229
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:22.269
Yes, sir. I attended with her last Sunday.

230
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.771
Beautiful sermon.

231
00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:28.609
All right, I tell you what.

232
00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:32.154
I'm a big fan of second chances.

233
00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.032
So, let me run all this
by the school board,

234
00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.701
and let me see if I can pull some strings
and make something happen.

235
00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.203
Thank you. Thank you.

236
00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:40.454
You're welcome.

237
00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:42.581
We thank you for this meal

238
00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:45.667
and for allowing the three of us
to be here together.

239
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:47.211
-Amen.
-Amen.

240
00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:48.337
Amen.

241
00:18:51.173 --> 00:18:54.009
Miss Vivian,
you never said you were sorry...

242
00:18:55.093 --> 00:18:58.597
for yesterday when you said
he shorted you, but he didn't.

243
00:19:00.933 --> 00:19:02.351
Sam, drink your milk.

244
00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:07.981
I miscounted.

245
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.192
I apologize.

246
00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:11.735
It's okay.

247
00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:16.156
Want me to get it?

248
00:19:18.617 --> 00:19:20.536
-No greens, no TV.
-Hello.

249
00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:22.371
-Yes, it is.
-Yes, ma'am.

250
00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:23.539
Yes, sir.

251
00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:28.168
Thank you. Okay. See you then.

252
00:19:34.383 --> 00:19:35.384
Got a job.

253
00:19:38.387 --> 00:19:39.847
Good for you, Palmer.

254
00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.391
-Oh, good.
-Cheers.

255
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:46.812
Now, bathrooms and classrooms
get done every day.

256
00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:51.900
We're the first that unlock the doors.
Kids get here soon after.

257
00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:54.820
Make sure you get here on time.
You need to wear this.

258
00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:56.238
Okay.

259
00:19:56.989 --> 00:19:58.532
Should I get a set of keys?

260
00:19:59.241 --> 00:20:00.742
Let's see how it goes first.

261
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.550
When you finish this, the air conditioner
in Maggie Hayes's room is busted.

262
00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.343
-I need you to fix it.
-Yes, sir.

263
00:20:18.427 --> 00:20:19.720
Gonna need these.

264
00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.682
Good job, Kayleigh.

265
00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.518
-I like those details.
-Snowflakes.

266
00:20:26.602 --> 00:20:29.521
I love that. Is that a house or a church?

267
00:20:30.606 --> 00:20:33.358
Stacy, I told you, put that away.

268
00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.363
Ma'am, air conditioner.

269
00:20:38.447 --> 00:20:40.949
Oh, yes. It's this one. Thank God.

270
00:20:43.202 --> 00:20:44.203
Palmer.

271
00:20:46.455 --> 00:20:49.082
-That's Palmer.
-"That's Palmer."

272
00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:51.793
Great. So, hopefully you can fix this.

273
00:20:51.877 --> 00:20:53.462
It's been making a crazy noise.

274
00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.589
It's been really hot,
and we haven't been able to use it.

275
00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:56.840
Stop, Toby!

276
00:20:56.924 --> 00:20:59.343
-Toby?
-I didn't do nothing.

277
00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.304
How would you feel
if someone did that to your painting?

278
00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.973
Go and get a paper towel
and help clean that up.

279
00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:07.267
All right, everybody, keep going.

280
00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:22.866
Four o'clock.

281
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.827
I know. I know.
Hey, Palmer, you met my wife yet, Lucille?

282
00:21:25.911 --> 00:21:27.579
-I haven't.
-It's nice to meet you.

283
00:21:27.663 --> 00:21:28.664
-You too.
-Heard a lot about you.

284
00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.415
You two have known each other
since you were little, huh?

285
00:21:30.499 --> 00:21:32.668
Yeah. Since we were five.
He was a little skinnier back then.

286
00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:33.836
Hey, we're working on that.

287
00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:35.921
Emily, come on.
Get your butt in this car. Let's go.

288
00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:38.590
It's just shameful
the way his mama carries on.

289
00:21:38.674 --> 00:21:41.635
I can't believe the state
hasn't taken him away already.

290
00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:45.264
He ain't no trouble, Dot. Now, shush.

291
00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:47.599
I'm telling you, you can't keep that boy.

292
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:54.022
Some people just have too much to say.

293
00:21:54.106 --> 00:21:55.691
Who has too much to say?

294
00:21:56.149 --> 00:22:00.320
Stop listening
to our adult conversations, Sam.

295
00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:04.116
But, Miss Vivian, I'm right here.

296
00:22:04.658 --> 00:22:06.493
Don't mean you have to listen.

297
00:22:09.288 --> 00:22:12.624
Dot's always sticking her nose
in other people's business.

298
00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:14.209
Whose business?

299
00:22:14.293 --> 00:22:16.461
I told you, stop listening, Sam.

300
00:22:17.296 --> 00:22:20.424
I can't stop listening, Miss Vivian,
if you keep talking.

301
00:22:20.966 --> 00:22:22.176
Jeez Louise!

302
00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:26.096
Hi, I'm Penelope.

303
00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.391
This is my world in the sky,
and these are my friends.

304
00:22:30.017 --> 00:22:31.226
Welcome to the club.

305
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.061
Get your wands ready.

306
00:22:33.145 --> 00:22:35.606
We fly together every day

307
00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:38.066
Making friends along the way

308
00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.402
Dot is cool and Phoebe's nice

309
00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:42.779
And I'm the one with sparkly tights

310
00:22:43.322 --> 00:22:45.115
Miss Vivian is still sleeping.

311
00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:49.745
Doesn't matter what people say

312
00:22:49.828 --> 00:22:52.331
Through the clouds we make our way

313
00:22:53.415 --> 00:22:54.499
Spread your wings

314
00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:57.461
In Penelope's Flying Princess Club

315
00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:17.856
We're here to celebrate Vivian Palmer,

316
00:23:18.524 --> 00:23:21.318
who we all hold deep in our hearts.

317
00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:27.366
In our celebration of remembering
her joy, laughter...

318
00:23:28.534 --> 00:23:30.035
and a life well lived,

319
00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:35.666
we will mourn Vivian
till we are once again reunited with her

320
00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:37.167
in the kingdom of heaven.

321
00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:43.590
Vivian was a fine woman.

322
00:23:46.552 --> 00:23:49.263
You take as much time
as you need, Palmer, all right?

323
00:25:25.651 --> 00:25:26.818
Where are we going?

324
00:25:30.739 --> 00:25:33.408
-Why'd I have to pack my bag?
-Don't worry about it.

325
00:25:44.002 --> 00:25:45.546
Come on. Get out.

326
00:25:55.889 --> 00:25:57.391
Come on.

327
00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:10.362
How long has she been gone this time?

328
00:26:10.445 --> 00:26:11.655
About two weeks now.

329
00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:14.700
And Vivian had him this whole time?

330
00:26:16.201 --> 00:26:19.037
Of course she did. I swear, this woman...

331
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:29.673
I ain't here right now,
so leave a message.

332
00:26:29.756 --> 00:26:31.258
Or don't. I don't give a shit.

333
00:26:34.595 --> 00:26:37.097
Well, I can't take him home.

334
00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:39.600
I mean, Emily alone is a handful.

335
00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:44.354
And you sure you can't hang on to him
for a little bit longer? You got the room.

336
00:26:44.438 --> 00:26:45.522
He ain't my problem.

337
00:26:47.024 --> 00:26:49.234
All right. Leave him.

338
00:26:53.906 --> 00:26:56.491
I'll put in a call to child services.

339
00:26:59.328 --> 00:27:01.580
He's gonna have to go in the system.

340
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.006
Palmer.

341
00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:12.299
Where are you going?

342
00:27:55.092 --> 00:27:56.218
Fuck.

343
00:29:25.474 --> 00:29:26.475
Palmer.

344
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.367
Miss Maggie gave me a ride home.

345
00:29:44.451 --> 00:29:46.078
-Hello.
-Come on in.

346
00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:48.622
Yeah, I just thought I'd say hello.

347
00:29:48.705 --> 00:29:50.415
Can I get you something to drink?

348
00:29:51.291 --> 00:29:53.669
Water would be great. Thanks.

349
00:29:53.752 --> 00:29:54.753
Right, sure.

350
00:29:56.421 --> 00:29:59.925
I don't care what we do
as long as we do it together.

351
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.971
-Last one to the moon is a beautiful egg.
-Beautiful?

352
00:30:04.054 --> 00:30:07.766
Miss Maggie, all the flying princesses
are flying to the moon.

353
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.935
Can you imagine? The moon.

354
00:30:10.018 --> 00:30:11.520
That's amazing.

355
00:30:11.603 --> 00:30:13.021
I love this!

356
00:30:13.105 --> 00:30:15.274
Hold on. Slow down.

357
00:30:15.357 --> 00:30:16.900
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

358
00:30:16.984 --> 00:30:17.985
No problem.

359
00:30:19.236 --> 00:30:21.780
Flying to the moon is my favorite.

360
00:30:21.864 --> 00:30:24.741
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Vivian.

361
00:30:24.825 --> 00:30:28.662
I didn't know her well,
but she seemed like a really good person.

362
00:30:29.246 --> 00:30:30.664
She was a good woman.

363
00:30:30.747 --> 00:30:34.084
She actually was watching Sam
quite a bit lately.

364
00:30:35.043 --> 00:30:37.045
You wouldn't know where Shelly is,
would you?

365
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.756
Your guess is as good as mine.

366
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.383
One, two, three.

367
00:30:41.466 --> 00:30:43.218
Princess power. Princess power...

368
00:30:43.302 --> 00:30:44.887
So, how's it going?

369
00:30:46.221 --> 00:30:49.975
Good. Yeah, fine.

370
00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:53.145
She's never really gone for too long.

371
00:30:53.896 --> 00:30:55.189
How about this?

372
00:30:55.272 --> 00:30:57.357
You know, I just give you my phone number,

373
00:30:57.441 --> 00:31:01.111
and if you have any questions,
or if you need anything,

374
00:31:01.195 --> 00:31:03.572
or if it's too much,
you just give me a call.

375
00:31:04.239 --> 00:31:06.074
Yeah, sure. That'd be helpful.

376
00:31:06.158 --> 00:31:07.367
Do you have a cell phone?

377
00:31:07.451 --> 00:31:10.329
No. Well, there's... one on the wall.

378
00:31:10.829 --> 00:31:12.706
-May I?
-Yeah, sure.

379
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:13.957
Old-school.

380
00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:16.668
I asked Sam if he wanted to stay with me,

381
00:31:16.752 --> 00:31:19.213
but he said he wanted
to stay here with you.

382
00:31:19.296 --> 00:31:20.380
Sparkles!

383
00:31:20.797 --> 00:31:22.216
This is good of you.

384
00:31:22.716 --> 00:31:25.427
You know, most people would've left him.

385
00:31:25.511 --> 00:31:28.514
Well, what was I supposed to do?

386
00:31:28.597 --> 00:31:30.641
Oh, my goodness. Is that a dragon?

387
00:31:30.724 --> 00:31:32.976
-Bye, Sam.
-Bye, Miss Maggie.

388
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.020
Okay, thanks.

389
00:31:35.729 --> 00:31:38.273
I ain't here right now,
so leave a message.

390
00:31:38.357 --> 00:31:39.733
Or don't. I don't give a shit.

391
00:31:52.037 --> 00:31:53.038
What you playing?

392
00:31:54.164 --> 00:31:55.165
Solitaire.

393
00:31:56.458 --> 00:31:57.459
Can I play?

394
00:31:58.043 --> 00:31:59.795
Nope, it's for one player.

395
00:32:07.511 --> 00:32:09.346
Is this a boy or a girl?

396
00:32:12.391 --> 00:32:13.392
Did you wash today?

397
00:32:13.851 --> 00:32:16.103
Yeah, I washed earlier.

398
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.650
You stink.

399
00:32:23.819 --> 00:32:25.320
Palmer!

400
00:32:33.412 --> 00:32:35.831
I just wanted to make sure
you were still here.

401
00:32:36.582 --> 00:32:38.417
-I'm watching TV.
-Okay.

402
00:32:41.044 --> 00:32:42.212
Palmer!

403
00:32:43.797 --> 00:32:45.215
Jesus Christ.

404
00:32:45.883 --> 00:32:47.092
What?

405
00:32:47.593 --> 00:32:50.095
You're not going anywhere, are you?

406
00:32:50.762 --> 00:32:52.556
No. I'm right here.

407
00:32:55.184 --> 00:32:56.393
Y'all ready to get out?

408
00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.521
I'm ready to get out!

409
00:33:03.025 --> 00:33:04.193
What's that?

410
00:33:04.693 --> 00:33:05.819
I'm ready to get out.

411
00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:08.906
Just get out. Here.

412
00:33:10.908 --> 00:33:11.909
It's cold.

413
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.954
At DuBois and Guidry,
we've been working to get you your money--

414
00:33:16.038 --> 00:33:17.623
All right.

415
00:33:18.123 --> 00:33:19.249
Go to sleep.

416
00:33:20.751 --> 00:33:21.752
Palmer.

417
00:33:24.588 --> 00:33:25.589
Yeah?

418
00:33:26.715 --> 00:33:29.134
Do you know when my mama's coming back?

419
00:33:30.594 --> 00:33:31.803
Nah, I wish I did.

420
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:37.601
I sometimes get mad
at my mama for leaving.

421
00:33:38.143 --> 00:33:39.978
Do you ever get mad at yours?

422
00:33:42.814 --> 00:33:44.191
I barely knew the woman.

423
00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:46.860
But you knew your daddy.

424
00:33:47.277 --> 00:33:48.278
That's right.

425
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:50.739
Do you miss him?

426
00:33:51.949 --> 00:33:52.950
Yeah.

427
00:33:53.575 --> 00:33:55.035
Yeah, sometimes I do.

428
00:33:55.118 --> 00:33:57.037
Miss Vivian missed him too.

429
00:33:58.539 --> 00:34:00.457
But now, she gets to see him.

430
00:34:05.254 --> 00:34:06.505
I'm sure she does.

431
00:34:07.965 --> 00:34:09.174
Go to sleep, Sam.

432
00:34:09.882 --> 00:34:12.344
Palmer? Good night.

433
00:34:14.638 --> 00:34:15.639
Good night.

434
00:35:42.267 --> 00:35:44.311
Hey. Get in.

435
00:35:54.947 --> 00:35:56.073
Hey, Palmer.

436
00:36:02.412 --> 00:36:03.747
My mama bought me this.

437
00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:07.626
She got it at a garage sale.

438
00:36:08.961 --> 00:36:12.381
She said it was a bargain
'cause she got it for 50 cents.

439
00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.634
And she said
there was this woman named Heifer,

440
00:36:15.717 --> 00:36:19.763
'cause that old heifer
tried to steal it out from my mama.

441
00:36:19.847 --> 00:36:21.390
But my mama wouldn't let her,

442
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.436
'cause she knew princesses
were my favorite thing in the whole world.

443
00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:41.326
All right. You guys are doing a great job.

444
00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.453
Tell me, what else do you see
in the ocean?

445
00:36:43.537 --> 00:36:44.705
Jellyfish?

446
00:36:44.788 --> 00:36:46.874
Jellyfish. And what do we see, Thomas?

447
00:37:01.638 --> 00:37:03.182
-Palmer?
-All right.

448
00:37:03.265 --> 00:37:04.474
Really?

449
00:37:05.392 --> 00:37:07.603
Okay. Hold on. Stay right here.

450
00:37:07.686 --> 00:37:08.896
Hey, Eddie.

451
00:37:08.979 --> 00:37:10.606
-Hey, it's Lucille.
-Hey.

452
00:37:10.689 --> 00:37:13.400
-Yeah, we met at church with Tommy.
-Yeah, right. Right.

453
00:37:13.483 --> 00:37:15.694
Yeah, Tommy mentioned
you're working at the school.

454
00:37:16.653 --> 00:37:17.654
So...

455
00:37:18.655 --> 00:37:20.073
Emily just adores Sam,

456
00:37:20.157 --> 00:37:23.076
and so I was wondering if it'd be okay
for them to have a playdate.

457
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.038
Sam said I had to ask you.
He said you were his daddy.

458
00:37:26.747 --> 00:37:27.789
Playdate?

459
00:37:27.873 --> 00:37:31.668
Yeah, they would come right now
over to our house so that they could play.

460
00:37:31.752 --> 00:37:32.878
It's called a playdate.

461
00:37:32.961 --> 00:37:38.091
And then you could just pick him up,
say, around 5:00.

462
00:37:39.218 --> 00:37:40.677
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah?

463
00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:41.803
Hey, guys.

464
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.182
-Told you.
-Let's do it.

465
00:38:02.241 --> 00:38:03.492
Look. He's early.

466
00:38:03.575 --> 00:38:06.078
Come in. Come on in.

467
00:38:06.828 --> 00:38:08.372
-Oh, Christ.
-What are you doing?

468
00:38:08.455 --> 00:38:09.665
Come on.

469
00:38:11.208 --> 00:38:13.669
I don't know. He's just sitting there.

470
00:38:13.752 --> 00:38:16.255
I'm not gonna bite. You can come in.

471
00:38:16.338 --> 00:38:17.923
-In--
-Yeah.

472
00:38:20.676 --> 00:38:22.344
I don't know what he's doing.

473
00:38:23.178 --> 00:38:24.555
To hell with it.

474
00:38:25.514 --> 00:38:26.515
Shit.

475
00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:28.809
Can I get you anything?

476
00:38:28.892 --> 00:38:30.435
-No, no, no. Yeah.
-You want anything? Okay.

477
00:38:30.519 --> 00:38:32.145
-Can I get your coat?
-No, I'm good.

478
00:38:32.229 --> 00:38:33.939
-Hey, Palmer.
-Hey, Sam.

479
00:38:34.022 --> 00:38:35.816
Is Coles still at work?

480
00:38:36.316 --> 00:38:38.151
Yeah. That's what he tells me.

481
00:38:39.361 --> 00:38:42.114
And look. It is teatime, see?

482
00:38:42.197 --> 00:38:44.116
Just make yourself comfortable right here.

483
00:38:44.199 --> 00:38:46.451
Actually, just-- You wanna sit--
This looks good.

484
00:38:46.535 --> 00:38:47.744
How many lumps do you want?

485
00:38:49.288 --> 00:38:51.456
She means sugar. Sugar.

486
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.541
Two.

487
00:38:56.295 --> 00:38:58.088
Careful, Palmer. It's hot.

488
00:38:59.006 --> 00:39:01.717
-Sir. This is beautiful.
-Thanks.

489
00:39:04.344 --> 00:39:05.888
Pinkies, please.

490
00:39:05.971 --> 00:39:07.222
Pinkies up.

491
00:39:10.475 --> 00:39:12.644
Do you know they drink tea in England?

492
00:39:12.728 --> 00:39:13.729
Yes.

493
00:39:13.812 --> 00:39:17.065
It's so good.
What do you think, Mr. Palmer?

494
00:39:19.401 --> 00:39:20.736
Yes.

495
00:39:20.819 --> 00:39:21.945
Real good.

496
00:39:22.029 --> 00:39:24.990
I love it.
I think I'll have a little more.

497
00:39:25.073 --> 00:39:26.700
-Bye, Miss Lucille.
-Bye, Sam.

498
00:39:26.783 --> 00:39:28.202
-Take care.
-Bye.

499
00:39:28.285 --> 00:39:29.995
Tea parties are my favorite.

500
00:39:30.913 --> 00:39:33.540
So, is Emily your girlfriend?

501
00:39:34.249 --> 00:39:37.377
She says she wants to marry me
when we get older.

502
00:39:37.461 --> 00:39:39.213
That sounds like a good offer.

503
00:39:39.296 --> 00:39:42.132
-I'm not gonna marry her.
-You never know. Maybe you will.

504
00:39:43.091 --> 00:39:45.427
Nah. She's a bossy little thing.

505
00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.513
You don't say.

506
00:39:47.596 --> 00:39:49.806
Okay. Yeah, all right, Daryl.

507
00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.518
Yeah, I'll be there.
I can't wait to see him play.

508
00:39:53.435 --> 00:39:54.436
Jesus.

509
00:39:55.145 --> 00:39:57.773
Hey, you ever been to a football game?

510
00:39:57.856 --> 00:39:59.107
Football?

511
00:40:12.746 --> 00:40:14.373
See that guy right out there?
Number three.

512
00:40:14.456 --> 00:40:16.708
That's the quarterback.
That's what I used to play.

513
00:40:16.792 --> 00:40:19.711
-Cool. Did you have a number?
-I sure did, number nine.

514
00:40:19.795 --> 00:40:21.171
-Well, look who it is.
-Hey.

515
00:40:21.255 --> 00:40:22.965
-Hi, Mr. Coles.
-Hey, Sammy.

516
00:40:23.048 --> 00:40:25.384
Heard y'all had yourself
a little tea party the other day.

517
00:40:25.467 --> 00:40:26.468
Yeah.

518
00:40:26.552 --> 00:40:29.763
Yeah, well, don't worry.
I've had to go to a few myself.

519
00:40:29.847 --> 00:40:30.848
I bet.

520
00:40:30.931 --> 00:40:33.767
God dang it. Max, Morgan,
get off that fence!

521
00:40:33.851 --> 00:40:35.561
Duty calls. Y'all enjoy the game.

522
00:40:35.644 --> 00:40:36.728
-All right, bud.
-Hey!

523
00:40:36.812 --> 00:40:37.980
-You hungry?
-Yep.

524
00:40:38.063 --> 00:40:40.274
-Thanks.
-Thank you very much.

525
00:40:40.357 --> 00:40:41.567
Hey, Miss Maggie.

526
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:44.528
Sam, what are you doing here?
Are you a Rebels fan now?

527
00:40:44.611 --> 00:40:48.991
Yep, that's the quarterback out there.
Palmer used to be him when he played.

528
00:40:49.074 --> 00:40:51.285
-Quarterback, huh?
-A long time ago.

529
00:40:51.368 --> 00:40:53.036
What can I get for you?

530
00:40:53.704 --> 00:40:54.830
I already know.

531
00:40:55.414 --> 00:40:56.498
-Cookies.
-Cookies.

532
00:40:56.582 --> 00:40:57.958
Cookies!

533
00:40:58.625 --> 00:41:00.460
-All right. It's on me, kiddo.
-Thanks.

534
00:41:00.544 --> 00:41:02.379
What else you got planned for the weekend?

535
00:41:02.462 --> 00:41:03.463
I don't know.

536
00:41:04.131 --> 00:41:06.633
Do you wanna come with me
to a bowling fundraiser tomorrow?

537
00:41:06.717 --> 00:41:09.553
-Sure. Can Palmer come too?
-No, no, no. Miss Maggie invited you.

538
00:41:09.636 --> 00:41:11.513
She don't care. Right, Miss Maggie?

539
00:41:11.597 --> 00:41:14.725
-Sure, you're more than welcome to join.
-I can't. I got things to do.

540
00:41:14.808 --> 00:41:18.020
No, you don't. You're lying.
You got nothing to do.

541
00:41:18.103 --> 00:41:19.730
Please, Palmer. Please.

542
00:41:19.813 --> 00:41:21.440
-I think someone wants you to come.
-You have to come.

543
00:41:21.523 --> 00:41:23.942
-Okay, all right. I'll go.
-Yes.

544
00:41:24.026 --> 00:41:27.738
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Riverside High,

545
00:41:27.821 --> 00:41:32.284
home of the Riverside Rebels
and the Honey Belles.

546
00:41:33.368 --> 00:41:34.369
Palmer!

547
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.914
-What's up, Palmer?
-Hey, Sibs. How are ya?

548
00:41:36.997 --> 00:41:37.998
All right.

549
00:41:38.081 --> 00:41:40.042
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

550
00:41:40.125 --> 00:41:43.670
Five dollars for the raffle tickets.
Five dollars. All the proceeds...

551
00:41:43.754 --> 00:41:45.339
All right, looks like we made it
just in time.

552
00:41:45.422 --> 00:41:48.091
Hey there, little fella.
Can I have one of those?

553
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.511
Thank you.

554
00:41:50.594 --> 00:41:52.596
How the hell
did you get stuck babysitting?

555
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:57.309
Hey, don't get mixed up with Shelly, man.

556
00:41:58.685 --> 00:42:01.813
Trust me on that. Keep your dick
as far away from that one as possible.

557
00:42:01.897 --> 00:42:03.398
She'll burn it right off.

558
00:42:05.192 --> 00:42:06.652
Good to have you home, man.

559
00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:09.154
-Cookie, cookie, cookie.
-Ned, Ned.

560
00:42:09.238 --> 00:42:11.281
-Leave the boy's cookies alone.
-It's a fumble!

561
00:42:11.365 --> 00:42:12.950
That's good, man.

562
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.244
Great play.

563
00:42:16.161 --> 00:42:18.997
Look, see? Number ten.
That's my boy, Jake, right there.

564
00:42:19.081 --> 00:42:20.082
Yeah. I see him.

565
00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:22.417
How they doing this season anyway?

566
00:42:22.501 --> 00:42:24.253
Are you kidding me? They're 3-0.

567
00:42:24.336 --> 00:42:26.463
Won that last game by three touchdowns.

568
00:42:26.547 --> 00:42:28.882
It's the best offensive line
I've seen in years.

569
00:42:35.264 --> 00:42:36.265
Hey...

570
00:42:36.932 --> 00:42:38.851
you ever see that Wessler kid anymore?

571
00:42:39.935 --> 00:42:40.978
Why?

572
00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:44.982
I tried looking him and his old man up.
Couldn't find either of 'em.

573
00:42:46.316 --> 00:42:49.403
Man, you gotta let that shit go.

574
00:42:52.239 --> 00:42:54.783
What you should have done
is beat his son's ass too.

575
00:42:54.867 --> 00:42:56.034
Nah.

576
00:42:56.118 --> 00:42:59.621
Well, he was the one bragging
about all that money his daddy got.

577
00:42:59.705 --> 00:43:01.915
Mind, there wasn't even
hardly nothing in there.

578
00:43:03.792 --> 00:43:05.377
And you go away for what?

579
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.671
Old man lived, right? He was fine.

580
00:43:07.754 --> 00:43:10.382
He was lucky you used
an aluminum bat instead of wood.

581
00:43:10.465 --> 00:43:11.884
Otherwise, he'd be dead.

582
00:43:15.053 --> 00:43:18.265
Hey, you did your time, Palmer.
You don't owe nobody shit.

583
00:43:19.474 --> 00:43:21.768
Unlike Coles.

584
00:43:22.686 --> 00:43:25.314
Left you standing there
with your dick in your hand.

585
00:43:25.397 --> 00:43:26.565
I ain't talking shit.

586
00:43:26.648 --> 00:43:28.817
If you gonna be mad at somebody,
it should be him.

587
00:43:30.527 --> 00:43:32.404
And there's the pass. Jake Reed...

588
00:43:32.487 --> 00:43:34.072
All right!

589
00:43:34.656 --> 00:43:37.910
What did I tell you?
Just like his goddamn daddy!

590
00:43:38.493 --> 00:43:40.454
Ladies and gentlemen, the Honey Belles!

591
00:43:40.537 --> 00:43:42.247
The Honey Belles.

592
00:43:46.793 --> 00:43:48.921
We are Riverside!

593
00:43:49.546 --> 00:43:51.256
We are Riverside!

594
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:55.469
Now, go on. Get inside
and lock this door behind me.

595
00:43:55.552 --> 00:43:56.970
Where are you going?

596
00:43:57.054 --> 00:43:58.597
Don't worry about it. It's grown-up stuff.

597
00:43:59.348 --> 00:44:01.099
Why can't I come with you?

598
00:44:01.183 --> 00:44:02.476
Because I said so.

599
00:44:03.143 --> 00:44:07.064
My favorite part was the Honey Belles.
My mama was a Honey Belle.

600
00:44:07.981 --> 00:44:09.316
I'm sure she was.

601
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:10.984
Now shut the door.

602
00:44:12.945 --> 00:44:13.946
Lock it.

603
00:44:21.912 --> 00:44:23.664
No, no, her name was Bubba-Jean...

604
00:44:24.706 --> 00:44:26.458
and she was from Havana, Alabama--

605
00:44:26.542 --> 00:44:29.628
-Hold on. Her name was Bubba-Jean?
-Here, kitty, kitty.

606
00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:31.004
So she was gonna come over,

607
00:44:31.088 --> 00:44:33.465
I was gonna give her
some of my grandmama's moonshine.

608
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:36.218
-Hey, Sibs.
-Hey, Jake.

609
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:37.636
-Hey!
-Hell of a catch.

610
00:44:37.719 --> 00:44:38.887
Great win, boys!

611
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:41.390
Hey, Jake!

612
00:44:41.473 --> 00:44:44.893
-Tommy held the line right here. Yeah.
-Kick ass and take names, all right?

613
00:44:45.477 --> 00:44:47.271
-Jake!
-We're doing what we do.

614
00:44:47.354 --> 00:44:49.898
-Best game y'all ever played.
-Hey.

615
00:44:49.982 --> 00:44:52.943
Too big of a football star now
to say "hi" to your old man?

616
00:44:53.735 --> 00:44:56.029
Let's get out of here. He's drunk.

617
00:44:58.156 --> 00:45:01.201
I'm gonna go get a beer. Jake.

618
00:45:02.327 --> 00:45:04.246
Hey, Palmer. Look who it is.

619
00:45:04.329 --> 00:45:06.206
It's your boss man, Sibs.

620
00:45:07.332 --> 00:45:09.209
Hey, get me a beer over here!

621
00:45:09.293 --> 00:45:12.212
Hey, how's my boy Palmer
working out for you?

622
00:45:12.296 --> 00:45:13.630
He's being a good boy for you?

623
00:45:14.464 --> 00:45:16.300
He's doing just fine, Daryl.

624
00:45:17.217 --> 00:45:19.678
I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?

625
00:45:20.804 --> 00:45:22.514
I'm just trying to have a drink here...

626
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.808
in peace.

627
00:45:24.892 --> 00:45:28.353
Yeah, well, if you're looking for peace,
I suggest you find another fucking bar.

628
00:45:28.437 --> 00:45:30.981
Where the hell is my beer?

629
00:45:33.233 --> 00:45:34.526
-I'll go.
-All right.

630
00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.529
Hey, Daryl. Come on. We got you a beer.

631
00:45:37.613 --> 00:45:40.449
-Come on. Let's play some pool.
-All right.

632
00:45:40.532 --> 00:45:42.701
-Yeah, let's play.
-Hey, let's play some pool.

633
00:45:42.784 --> 00:45:44.661
-All right.
-Coles, grab our shit.

634
00:45:48.415 --> 00:45:50.959
Good morning. Wake up.

635
00:45:52.753 --> 00:45:54.796
I can't wait to go bowling.

636
00:45:56.965 --> 00:45:59.760
-What are you doing with that?
-It's for you.

637
00:46:02.179 --> 00:46:03.222
Go get dressed.

638
00:46:31.041 --> 00:46:32.167
Yes!

639
00:46:42.761 --> 00:46:44.638
-Okay.
-All right!

640
00:46:44.721 --> 00:46:45.722
Pretty good.

641
00:46:46.348 --> 00:46:48.267
Oh, my gosh! Good job!

642
00:46:49.685 --> 00:46:51.353
Good job, Sammy!

643
00:46:51.436 --> 00:46:53.897
I like those dance moves, man.

644
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.111
I'm done.
Can I have some money to play some games?

645
00:47:02.072 --> 00:47:03.073
Thank you.

646
00:47:04.283 --> 00:47:06.118
And we're leaving in ten minutes.

647
00:47:06.201 --> 00:47:07.202
Okay.

648
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:10.497
Did you get one of these yet?

649
00:47:10.581 --> 00:47:13.000
Nope. One on the wall still works.

650
00:47:15.544 --> 00:47:18.589
So, quarterback at Riverside.

651
00:47:20.632 --> 00:47:21.967
Yeah, the glory days.

652
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:23.886
And then I went on to LSU.

653
00:47:26.847 --> 00:47:28.682
What? What is that face?

654
00:47:29.474 --> 00:47:31.560
I'm a closeted Bulldogs fan.

655
00:47:32.102 --> 00:47:33.228
You went to Georgia?

656
00:47:33.312 --> 00:47:35.147
Go, Dawgs! Sic 'em!

657
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.191
No, no. You can't say that around here.

658
00:47:37.274 --> 00:47:40.402
You're the first person I told,
so if you tell anyone, I will deny it.

659
00:47:40.485 --> 00:47:41.778
Your secret is safe with me.

660
00:47:41.862 --> 00:47:43.197
Thank you.

661
00:47:44.615 --> 00:47:47.618
I only went to LSU
for about a year, and then...

662
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.080
then got sort of a different education.

663
00:47:55.459 --> 00:47:57.294
Yeah, I did hear about that.

664
00:47:58.629 --> 00:47:59.838
People like to talk.

665
00:48:00.464 --> 00:48:01.590
Don't I know.

666
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.595
And now to be back here, it's a...

667
00:48:08.055 --> 00:48:10.349
Yes! Another jackpot!

668
00:48:10.432 --> 00:48:12.184
So, how'd you end up here?

669
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:17.814
I was in a different institution.

670
00:48:19.399 --> 00:48:20.609
Marriage.

671
00:48:21.735 --> 00:48:24.071
Yeah, I was married and living in Atlanta.

672
00:48:24.947 --> 00:48:28.283
He and I met in college.
Tied the knot right after.

673
00:48:29.409 --> 00:48:30.827
Things didn't work out.

674
00:48:30.911 --> 00:48:33.539
Once the divorce was final,
I wanted to be closer to my family.

675
00:48:33.622 --> 00:48:35.207
And I got a cousin here in Sylvain, so...

676
00:48:36.583 --> 00:48:37.584
I moved.

677
00:48:39.586 --> 00:48:42.339
You know, sometimes, yeah,
it can be a little too...

678
00:48:43.715 --> 00:48:45.008
country.

679
00:49:16.748 --> 00:49:18.458
Trash bins need to be washed out.

680
00:49:18.542 --> 00:49:20.961
Take 'em round back.
There's a hose. Wipe 'em down.

681
00:49:21.503 --> 00:49:22.504
Yes, sir.

682
00:49:26.216 --> 00:49:29.469
Hey, Daryl was an asshole in high school.

683
00:49:30.053 --> 00:49:31.263
Not much has changed.

684
00:49:31.763 --> 00:49:34.433
Personally,
I don't spend time with assholes.

685
00:49:35.642 --> 00:49:36.643
Yes, sir.

686
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.568
Sam.

687
00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:47.070
-Come talk with me for a moment.
-Okay.

688
00:49:57.456 --> 00:50:00.292
I saw that Mr. Palmer
gave you a ride to school this morning.

689
00:50:01.084 --> 00:50:03.170
-Does he always do that?
-Yes, sir.

690
00:50:03.962 --> 00:50:06.465
And he lives right next door to you.
Is that right?

691
00:50:06.548 --> 00:50:09.259
His house is right beside
my mama's trailer.

692
00:50:11.136 --> 00:50:12.638
And he's always nice to you?

693
00:50:13.222 --> 00:50:14.515
Yes, sir.

694
00:50:14.598 --> 00:50:15.974
And everything's okay?

695
00:50:22.105 --> 00:50:26.068
Sam, if everything weren't okay,
you could tell me, no matter what it is.

696
00:50:29.029 --> 00:50:31.198
It's okay, son. Go on.

697
00:50:33.992 --> 00:50:37.412
Your breath smells kinda funny.

698
00:50:41.166 --> 00:50:43.001
Okay. Well, carry on.

699
00:50:49.466 --> 00:50:50.592
Rinse.

700
00:50:52.553 --> 00:50:54.555
Come on. Get dressed. Can't be late.

701
00:51:03.522 --> 00:51:04.940
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

702
00:51:06.191 --> 00:51:07.317
Good luck to you.

703
00:51:13.156 --> 00:51:14.157
Bye.

704
00:51:14.867 --> 00:51:16.577
You like root beer floats?

705
00:51:17.244 --> 00:51:19.329
I don't know. Never had one.

706
00:51:20.038 --> 00:51:22.457
What? Never had one?

707
00:51:23.333 --> 00:51:24.334
Come on, man.

708
00:51:26.962 --> 00:51:28.213
Well?

709
00:51:29.339 --> 00:51:30.883
Heaven in a cup.

710
00:51:34.636 --> 00:51:37.222
Why did you have to go see
that man anyways?

711
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:43.520
'Cause I did something bad,
and he's gotta check up on me

712
00:51:43.604 --> 00:51:45.105
to make sure I'm doing good now.

713
00:51:45.731 --> 00:51:46.857
Well, what'd you do?

714
00:51:49.735 --> 00:51:52.196
I wasn't a nice person.

715
00:51:52.988 --> 00:51:54.406
I hurt somebody.

716
00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.493
And I stole money and a whole lot
of other things that didn't belong to me.

717
00:51:59.244 --> 00:52:03.248
My mama stole money once,
but she never had to go see that man.

718
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:08.212
Some people get caught, and some don't.
I got caught.

719
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:12.966
My mom said she had to steal
'cause we were poor.

720
00:52:13.592 --> 00:52:15.594
Lots of people are poor. They don't steal.

721
00:52:15.677 --> 00:52:16.720
You did.

722
00:52:18.555 --> 00:52:21.725
That's right, I did. And I wish I hadn't.

723
00:52:24.102 --> 00:52:25.312
I stole too.

724
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.272
You did, huh?

725
00:52:29.316 --> 00:52:31.527
You think that person
misses what you took?

726
00:52:32.486 --> 00:52:35.197
I know she does. She cried in class.

727
00:52:35.781 --> 00:52:39.409
Miss Maggie asked if anyone had seen it,
and I said no.

728
00:52:40.827 --> 00:52:41.954
So you lied too.

729
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:48.877
You think that little girl would feel
better if she got back what you stole?

730
00:52:50.003 --> 00:52:53.423
Yeah. I think I'd feel better too.

731
00:52:53.966 --> 00:52:55.384
I bet she'd appreciate it.

732
00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:06.854
I stole from Miss Vivian too,
but I can't give it back.

733
00:53:06.937 --> 00:53:08.146
You did, huh?

734
00:53:10.399 --> 00:53:11.567
I was hungry.

735
00:53:13.652 --> 00:53:14.736
It's all right.

736
00:53:16.321 --> 00:53:19.867
But I bet if you'd asked Miss Vivian
for anything in the world,

737
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:21.368
she'd have helped you out.

738
00:53:21.451 --> 00:53:22.578
What do you think?

739
00:53:23.412 --> 00:53:26.206
Yeah, think she would've.

740
00:53:27.666 --> 00:53:28.667
Me too.

741
00:53:32.588 --> 00:53:35.424
You ain't gonna go all psycho on me
after all that sugar, are you?

742
00:53:37.593 --> 00:53:39.553
All right, tucked in there.

743
00:53:40.971 --> 00:53:43.891
This is way more comfier than the couch.

744
00:53:43.974 --> 00:53:45.809
Well, that's 'cause it's a bed.

745
00:53:48.353 --> 00:53:49.354
Palmer?

746
00:53:51.523 --> 00:53:52.524
Yeah?

747
00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:55.861
Nothing.

748
00:53:57.446 --> 00:53:58.447
Good night, Sam.

749
00:53:59.573 --> 00:54:00.574
Night.

750
00:54:49.748 --> 00:54:52.543
You think maybe we ought to put
something else in there today?

751
00:54:53.168 --> 00:54:54.169
Okay.

752
00:54:54.253 --> 00:54:56.338
Grab that loaf of bread and a plastic bag.

753
00:55:00.133 --> 00:55:01.510
Throw it on the table.

754
00:55:04.179 --> 00:55:05.180
Sit down.

755
00:55:07.432 --> 00:55:08.642
All right.

756
00:55:08.725 --> 00:55:11.228
Now, not many people know this.

757
00:55:11.979 --> 00:55:12.980
When I was your age,

758
00:55:13.063 --> 00:55:16.567
I won the state sandwich-making contest
three years in a row.

759
00:55:17.734 --> 00:55:19.987
There's no state sandwich contest.

760
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.905
There ain't? Then how'd I win?

761
00:55:23.073 --> 00:55:26.660
Now, the secret is you gotta spread
the mustard evenly

762
00:55:26.743 --> 00:55:28.328
on both slices of bread.

763
00:55:28.412 --> 00:55:29.705
Judges love that.

764
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:31.874
You're fibbing.

765
00:55:36.837 --> 00:55:38.046
Are you calling me a liar?

766
00:55:40.591 --> 00:55:42.009
A matter of fact, I am.

767
00:55:43.927 --> 00:55:45.053
Yeah, I am.

768
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.515
Look, just do me a favor, okay?

769
00:55:49.683 --> 00:55:52.769
You can have the cookies,
but will you just eat this before?

770
00:55:53.228 --> 00:55:54.521
Okay.

771
00:55:55.105 --> 00:55:56.773
Attakid. Let's do it.

772
00:55:58.275 --> 00:55:59.359
Morning, Sam.

773
00:55:59.443 --> 00:56:00.736
Hey, Mr. Sibs.

774
00:56:01.528 --> 00:56:02.779
Early, huh?

775
00:56:02.863 --> 00:56:04.239
Early bird gets the worm.

776
00:56:32.476 --> 00:56:34.853
...dear Sam

777
00:56:34.937 --> 00:56:38.649
Happy birthday to you

778
00:56:38.732 --> 00:56:39.816
There you go.

779
00:56:40.984 --> 00:56:42.694
One left. One left!

780
00:56:42.778 --> 00:56:44.321
Blow it.

781
00:56:44.404 --> 00:56:45.405
There you go.

782
00:56:48.158 --> 00:56:49.368
I hope you like it.

783
00:56:50.786 --> 00:56:53.038
A guitar! But I don't know how to play it.

784
00:56:54.248 --> 00:56:58.210
It's actually called a ukulele,
and I'll show you how to play it.

785
00:56:58.293 --> 00:56:59.294
Here.

786
00:57:00.295 --> 00:57:01.296
There you go.

787
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:02.381
So here's your notes.

788
00:57:02.464 --> 00:57:05.217
G, C, E, A.

789
00:57:06.301 --> 00:57:07.636
And what you want to say is

790
00:57:07.719 --> 00:57:11.390
My dog has fleas

791
00:57:11.473 --> 00:57:13.809
-What do you think about that?
-Cool.

792
00:57:13.892 --> 00:57:14.893
Try it.

793
00:57:15.811 --> 00:57:19.106
My dog has fleas

794
00:57:19.189 --> 00:57:20.899
-Wow!
-That's pretty good.

795
00:57:20.983 --> 00:57:23.402
-Thanks.
-My dog really does have fleas.

796
00:57:24.862 --> 00:57:26.113
Good to know.

797
00:57:26.196 --> 00:57:28.365
Try it again.
See if y'all can do it together.

798
00:57:28.448 --> 00:57:30.784
My dog has fleas

799
00:57:30.868 --> 00:57:32.870
My dog has fleas

800
00:57:33.704 --> 00:57:34.913
My dog has fleas

801
00:57:34.997 --> 00:57:36.957
-That was a mistake.
-Oh, yeah.

802
00:57:39.042 --> 00:57:40.043
Is this you?

803
00:57:42.004 --> 00:57:44.798
-Yeah.
-Look at how cute you were.

804
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.466
All right.

805
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:49.553
Did Vivian raise you alone?

806
00:57:51.221 --> 00:57:53.932
My dad passed away
when I was in high school.

807
00:57:54.016 --> 00:57:55.225
She took care of me.

808
00:57:55.976 --> 00:57:57.144
And your mother?

809
00:57:57.769 --> 00:57:59.563
Ran off when I was about five.

810
00:58:01.023 --> 00:58:02.816
Vivian was more like a mother to me.

811
00:58:08.614 --> 00:58:10.032
It's a lot of mail you got here.

812
00:58:11.283 --> 00:58:12.284
Yeah, I know.

813
00:58:13.452 --> 00:58:15.078
You know you gotta open it, right?

814
00:58:15.162 --> 00:58:18.081
Why? Can't be anything good in there.

815
00:58:18.165 --> 00:58:21.460
If you want,
I can help you sort through some of it.

816
00:58:21.543 --> 00:58:22.544
Nah, you don't have to do that.

817
00:58:22.628 --> 00:58:26.507
I know I don't have to.
There might be some cool coupons in there.

818
00:58:28.091 --> 00:58:29.343
Jesus.

819
00:58:29.426 --> 00:58:31.970
Hey, be careful with that.

820
00:58:34.723 --> 00:58:38.310
All right, this one is for $12.61.

821
00:58:38.393 --> 00:58:39.394
Okay.

822
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:44.149
There's 13 even,
and you can keep the change.

823
00:58:44.233 --> 00:58:45.484
Thank you.

824
00:58:47.444 --> 00:58:49.655
-Do you wanna do the lawyer next?
-Yeah. Yeah.

825
00:58:50.322 --> 00:58:51.365
All right.

826
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:54.451
What's it say?

827
00:58:57.538 --> 00:58:58.789
It's about Vivian's will.

828
00:58:58.872 --> 00:59:02.084
The lawyer just wants you to call him
as soon as you can.

829
00:59:02.167 --> 00:59:03.210
That's it?

830
00:59:06.255 --> 00:59:07.422
Okay.

831
00:59:07.506 --> 00:59:11.260
This Eddie Palmer?
Were you aware of Vivian's will?

832
00:59:11.343 --> 00:59:12.594
No, I'm not.

833
00:59:13.512 --> 00:59:15.430
Well,
according to your grandmother's will,

834
00:59:15.514 --> 00:59:17.641
her house and land
are to be put up for sale,

835
00:59:17.724 --> 00:59:21.311
and the money is gonna be donated
to the Saints of Christ Church.

836
00:59:21.395 --> 00:59:25.148
But she also left instructions
that you'll receive $5,000.

837
00:59:25.232 --> 00:59:26.483
Hold on. She--

838
00:59:27.442 --> 00:59:29.444
She's giving the house to the church?

839
00:59:30.529 --> 00:59:31.738
These are her wishes?

840
00:59:32.531 --> 00:59:34.157
I'm afraid so.

841
00:59:34.241 --> 00:59:36.201
Do you have any other questions?

842
00:59:37.828 --> 00:59:40.038
When do I gotta move out?

843
00:59:40.122 --> 00:59:41.915
Well, once the house sells,

844
00:59:41.999 --> 00:59:44.543
you'll have 30 days
to vacate the premises.

845
00:59:47.504 --> 00:59:51.049
'Kay, ready? Snap to the right.

846
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.260
Turn to the left.

847
00:59:53.343 --> 00:59:56.096
-Go like that. Not like...
-This?

848
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:58.307
Okay? So get like-- Yeah.

849
00:59:58.390 --> 01:00:01.018
Hey, Sam. Why do you act like a girl?

850
01:00:02.978 --> 01:00:04.104
I-- I don't know.

851
01:00:04.646 --> 01:00:06.690
I know why. 'Cause he's a faggot.

852
01:00:08.317 --> 01:00:10.152
Stop, Toby.

853
01:00:11.111 --> 01:00:14.031
He's probably going
as a fairy for Halloween.

854
01:00:17.075 --> 01:00:18.410
What you gonna do about it?

855
01:00:18.869 --> 01:00:19.870
Nothing.

856
01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:24.499
Go on to class, Sam.

857
01:00:26.835 --> 01:00:28.003
Y'all get outta here.

858
01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.303
You touch that boy again,
I'm gonna break your arm.

859
01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:37.930
Got it?

860
01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:39.973
Go.

861
01:00:49.775 --> 01:00:54.655
And remember, if you wanna be a member
of Penelope's Flying Princess Club,

862
01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:57.366
all you have to do is write us a letter.

863
01:00:57.449 --> 01:01:00.118
We'll even mail you a certificate.

864
01:01:00.202 --> 01:01:01.703
I love new members.

865
01:01:01.787 --> 01:01:04.748
Penelope the Princess said
if you write their show a letter,

866
01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:06.917
you can join their club.

867
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.169
They even give you a certificate.

868
01:01:09.253 --> 01:01:11.088
Okay, everybody fly back.

869
01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:12.589
Can you write me one?

870
01:01:13.257 --> 01:01:14.258
Look.

871
01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:17.469
There's things in this world you can be,
and there's things that you can't.

872
01:01:17.553 --> 01:01:19.847
-...ready for adventure.
-Okay?

873
01:01:20.389 --> 01:01:22.724
How many boys do you see on that show?

874
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:26.311
-None.
-And what does that tell you?

875
01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:29.439
-That I can be the first.
-Here goes.

876
01:01:30.607 --> 01:01:33.569
Sparkles! Hello, Sparkles.

877
01:01:33.652 --> 01:01:36.154
Gemma, Lilly, come on.

878
01:01:36.655 --> 01:01:38.657
Look! They have it.

879
01:01:39.324 --> 01:01:40.492
Can I get it?

880
01:01:41.285 --> 01:01:44.621
What about being Peter the Prince
or, I don't know, a pirate?

881
01:01:44.705 --> 01:01:47.833
I don't wanna be a pirate.
I wanna be Penelope the Princess.

882
01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:50.210
You can't be a princess,
so pick something else.

883
01:01:50.294 --> 01:01:52.754
Why? Emily is going as a princess.

884
01:01:52.838 --> 01:01:55.382
-Emily is a girl.
-So?

885
01:01:57.968 --> 01:01:59.887
Come here. Look at me.

886
01:02:01.597 --> 01:02:05.642
Some costumes are made for girls,
and some are made for boys.

887
01:02:05.726 --> 01:02:09.313
Now, it don't mean you can't wear it.
You can.

888
01:02:09.396 --> 01:02:11.231
But kids are mean.

889
01:02:11.315 --> 01:02:14.818
Especially when they see something
that they ain't used to seeing.

890
01:02:14.902 --> 01:02:18.780
They just expect to see
a girl wearing this costume.

891
01:02:19.489 --> 01:02:21.366
Like your friend Emily.

892
01:02:22.284 --> 01:02:24.411
They should make one for boys.

893
01:02:24.494 --> 01:02:25.495
They do.

894
01:02:27.122 --> 01:02:28.457
It's Peter the Prince.

895
01:02:33.587 --> 01:02:35.172
You ready for Halloween?

896
01:02:35.255 --> 01:02:36.465
Yep. I can't wait.

897
01:02:36.882 --> 01:02:39.009
You have yourself a good time.

898
01:02:39.092 --> 01:02:41.553
Eddie Palmer. Hello, Sam.

899
01:02:42.095 --> 01:02:43.972
You still looking after this boy?

900
01:02:44.056 --> 01:02:46.850
You got no right looking after any child.

901
01:02:46.934 --> 01:02:48.644
You ain't nothing but a criminal.

902
01:02:48.727 --> 01:02:49.811
Come on, Sam.

903
01:02:50.479 --> 01:02:51.522
You know what?

904
01:02:51.605 --> 01:02:54.650
Palmer's been seeing that man,
and he's been doing good.

905
01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:57.152
So you can mind your own ass.

906
01:02:57.236 --> 01:02:58.403
Come on.

907
01:02:58.487 --> 01:03:00.781
I am calling child services.

908
01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.115
Hey, Sam?

909
01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:05.536
I'm doing good, huh?

910
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:09.581
Real good.

911
01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:13.335
Come on.

912
01:03:14.378 --> 01:03:17.923
I can't wait to see what everyone's
gonna be for Halloween tomorrow.

913
01:03:18.006 --> 01:03:19.842
Group three, you can get your backpacks.

914
01:03:20.425 --> 01:03:21.426
Bye, sweetie.

915
01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:25.597
Hey, Sam. Do you have
a Halloween costume for tomorrow?

916
01:03:25.681 --> 01:03:29.309
Uh-huh. Penelope the Flying Princess.
Palmer got it for me.

917
01:03:29.935 --> 01:03:33.772
Penelope? That's exciting.
Okay, I can't wait to see it.

918
01:03:33.856 --> 01:03:35.524
-Goodbye, Miss Maggie.
-Bye.

919
01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:46.076
Quite an outfit.

920
01:03:46.702 --> 01:03:48.745
I can't get it to stay on my head.

921
01:03:49.955 --> 01:03:50.956
Come here.

922
01:04:03.468 --> 01:04:05.846
There you go. I hope that works.

923
01:04:06.555 --> 01:04:08.974
Me too. Thanks.

924
01:04:09.474 --> 01:04:10.517
You're welcome, kiddo.

925
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.356
Let me guess. Pink or purple.
You can't decide.

926
01:04:18.066 --> 01:04:20.611
I'm the flying princess cowboy.

927
01:04:20.694 --> 01:04:22.613
Let's ride. Giddy-giddy.

928
01:04:22.696 --> 01:04:25.866
Samantha is wearing a girl's costume.

929
01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:28.368
She's probably wearing panties.

930
01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:38.253
Excuse me, class.

931
01:04:39.254 --> 01:04:42.466
Does anybody know where Miss Maggie is?

932
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:44.218
-You're right there!
-No.

933
01:04:44.301 --> 01:04:46.887
No, I'm not. I'm Principal Forbes.

934
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:49.181
And that's a fake mustache!

935
01:04:49.848 --> 01:04:53.560
It's a real mustache.
I grew it this morning.

936
01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:55.020
No!

937
01:04:55.103 --> 01:04:57.105
Miss Maggie must be playing hooky,

938
01:04:57.189 --> 01:05:00.567
'cause today Principal Forbes
is taking care of your classroom.

939
01:05:00.651 --> 01:05:03.737
-No.
-Yes, I am. You see,

940
01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:08.325
that is the entire point of Halloween
or any other day of the year.

941
01:05:08.408 --> 01:05:11.161
You can just be whoever you wanna be.

942
01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:14.164
I'm a cowboy!

943
01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:15.374
Is that an astronaut?

944
01:05:15.457 --> 01:05:16.792
And we got a witch.

945
01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.168
And is that--

946
01:05:18.794 --> 01:05:22.381
That looks like a flying princess.
Yes, it does.

947
01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:24.091
And another one.

948
01:05:24.675 --> 01:05:25.801
And another one.

949
01:05:25.884 --> 01:05:29.221
How wonderful does everybody look today?

950
01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:34.434
-Trick or treat!
-I've got some treats.

951
01:05:34.518 --> 01:05:36.228
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

952
01:05:36.311 --> 01:05:37.771
These are my favorite.

953
01:05:38.814 --> 01:05:41.149
-Wow. Nice place you got.
-Thank you.

954
01:05:41.233 --> 01:05:42.985
Who are you for Halloween?

955
01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:44.486
-Me?
-Yeah.

956
01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:45.737
I was a janitor.

957
01:05:46.655 --> 01:05:48.240
You want to give me a hand?

958
01:05:48.323 --> 01:05:49.825
That's enough candy, Sam.

959
01:05:55.163 --> 01:05:57.040
-That was so good.
-Good, good.

960
01:05:57.124 --> 01:05:59.793
-How's he doing?
-He's watching TV in there.

961
01:06:00.252 --> 01:06:01.461
Boy loves TV.

962
01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:03.630
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

963
01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:08.051
It turned out to be
a really good day at school today.

964
01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:09.178
That's good.

965
01:06:09.678 --> 01:06:11.597
I think he really had fun.

966
01:06:16.393 --> 01:06:18.145
And I'm glad you guys
stopped by for dinner.

967
01:06:19.229 --> 01:06:20.480
Me too.

968
01:06:22.191 --> 01:06:23.609
So, I gotta ask you something.

969
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:27.821
Okay.

970
01:06:30.199 --> 01:06:31.992
How did you end up in prison?

971
01:06:35.579 --> 01:06:37.122
That's a longer story.

972
01:06:37.206 --> 01:06:38.957
I don't know. I don't get it.

973
01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:41.752
It's a fair question.

974
01:06:52.596 --> 01:06:55.807
Things were going okay at LSU.

975
01:06:57.643 --> 01:07:01.980
Until one game, I get hit so hard,
I can't even tell you my name.

976
01:07:04.691 --> 01:07:09.238
Couple surgeries,
and that was the end of football

977
01:07:09.738 --> 01:07:10.906
and school.

978
01:07:12.658 --> 01:07:16.745
Came back home. Started taking pills.

979
01:07:19.414 --> 01:07:20.624
Doing other things.

980
01:07:23.168 --> 01:07:24.670
I'd end up in jail for a night...

981
01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:27.881
swear I wouldn't do it again.

982
01:07:31.385 --> 01:07:32.678
There was this rich kid.

983
01:07:33.428 --> 01:07:34.805
He was always going on and on,

984
01:07:34.888 --> 01:07:38.058
bragging about how much money
his dad kept in the safe at the house.

985
01:07:39.184 --> 01:07:42.855
One night, me and the guys, we broke in.

986
01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:45.524
Nobody was supposed to be there.

987
01:07:46.358 --> 01:07:47.985
His old man comes home.

988
01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:50.279
Had a gun.

989
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:58.537
I nearly beat him to death.

990
01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:06.128
And the next thing I know, I'm in prison.

991
01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.133
You weren't alone?

992
01:08:11.675 --> 01:08:14.303
Don't matter. I did what I did.

993
01:08:17.598 --> 01:08:18.765
Yeah.

994
01:08:20.642 --> 01:08:22.185
But look at what you did today.

995
01:08:49.212 --> 01:08:50.214
He's out.

996
01:08:54.301 --> 01:08:55.301
Are you tired?

997
01:08:58.764 --> 01:08:59.765
No.

998
01:10:10.794 --> 01:10:13.338
I swear that boy will sleep
through a freight train.

999
01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:21.346
This was fun.

1000
01:10:26.059 --> 01:10:27.728
-All right.
-All right.

1001
01:10:29.104 --> 01:10:30.606
I guess I'll see you at school.

1002
01:10:34.109 --> 01:10:36.069
-Good night.
-Good night.

1003
01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:39.907
Still looking.

1004
01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:48.999
All right, guys.
I'll give you a few more minutes.

1005
01:10:49.082 --> 01:10:51.043
And it's okay if you make a mistake.

1006
01:10:51.126 --> 01:10:53.253
Sam, do you wanna have another tea party?

1007
01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:54.463
Can we play dress-up?

1008
01:10:54.922 --> 01:10:56.048
Of course.

1009
01:10:56.131 --> 01:10:57.799
-I'm in.
-Yeah.

1010
01:10:59.801 --> 01:11:02.387
What are we going to do, huh? Hey, Eddie.

1011
01:11:02.471 --> 01:11:04.223
Hey, they are so excited.

1012
01:11:04.306 --> 01:11:08.143
Listen, listen. Don't even rush yourself.
Just come whenever you're ready, okay?

1013
01:11:08.227 --> 01:11:10.979
And Daryl's stopping by too.
We can all have a beer.

1014
01:11:11.063 --> 01:11:13.732
-Say hello to Tommy.
-I will. We're gonna have fun.

1015
01:11:13.815 --> 01:11:15.984
-See you later, Palmer.
-See ya, bud.

1016
01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:00.737
May I help you?

1017
01:12:02.114 --> 01:12:03.949
How's that air conditioner working out?

1018
01:12:07.536 --> 01:12:08.954
You're gonna get me in trouble.

1019
01:12:09.997 --> 01:12:10.998
Am I?

1020
01:12:16.253 --> 01:12:19.464
-I gotta go.
-No, you don't.

1021
01:12:19.548 --> 01:12:21.717
Yes. Yes, I do.

1022
01:12:26.513 --> 01:12:27.681
Hey.

1023
01:12:28.724 --> 01:12:29.725
Hey.

1024
01:12:31.059 --> 01:12:32.436
Will you help me with something?

1025
01:12:33.687 --> 01:12:35.397
-Yeah.
-Come here.

1026
01:12:39.776 --> 01:12:42.404
I don't know. All this stuff.

1027
01:12:43.488 --> 01:12:45.240
Do you know anybody who could use it?

1028
01:12:46.617 --> 01:12:48.702
I think my grandmother
would've loved that.

1029
01:12:52.414 --> 01:12:53.624
Yeah, I'm sure I do.

1030
01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:00.797
Sam!

1031
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:04.551
-Hey, bud.
-What happened to you?

1032
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:08.472
-Eddie, I am so--
-What the hell is going on?

1033
01:13:08.555 --> 01:13:11.225
I don't even know. I left him for a bit.
They were playing dress-up.

1034
01:13:11.308 --> 01:13:14.728
When I came back, he had makeup smeared
all over his face and he was crying.

1035
01:13:14.811 --> 01:13:16.772
I don't even know what happened.
I'm sorry.

1036
01:13:16.855 --> 01:13:18.607
It's okay. It's okay, sweetie.

1037
01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:20.484
Hey, buddy. Hey.

1038
01:13:20.567 --> 01:13:22.653
You wanna tell me and Miss Maggie
what happened?

1039
01:13:24.613 --> 01:13:25.864
Hey. It's all right.

1040
01:13:26.949 --> 01:13:29.785
Was it the same ones that pick on you?
Were they over there?

1041
01:13:32.079 --> 01:13:33.413
Listen to me, son.

1042
01:13:33.497 --> 01:13:36.917
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but sometimes you gotta hit 'em back.

1043
01:13:37.626 --> 01:13:38.752
Eddie.

1044
01:13:39.253 --> 01:13:40.504
They were bigger than me.

1045
01:13:40.587 --> 01:13:43.048
I know, son, but if you don't stand up
for yourself now,

1046
01:13:43.131 --> 01:13:45.008
those kids are never
gonna leave you alone.

1047
01:13:45.092 --> 01:13:46.093
Eddie.

1048
01:13:46.176 --> 01:13:48.387
They weren't kids.

1049
01:13:49.513 --> 01:13:51.390
What do you mean?

1050
01:13:51.849 --> 01:13:54.685
Okay, look at me, okay?
Who did this to you, Sam?

1051
01:13:55.853 --> 01:13:57.145
It's okay. You can tell us.

1052
01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:01.316
Toby's dad.

1053
01:14:02.234 --> 01:14:03.277
What?

1054
01:14:03.944 --> 01:14:08.782
Toby's dad. Your friend, Daryl, he did it.

1055
01:14:12.744 --> 01:14:13.745
Hey, Eddie.

1056
01:14:16.123 --> 01:14:17.124
Hey, Eddie.

1057
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.502
Eddie. Hey, Eddie! Where are you going?

1058
01:14:21.003 --> 01:14:22.337
Eddie, don't do--

1059
01:14:37.603 --> 01:14:41.356
Hey, look. He was already wearing a dress.
I just gave the little faggot some--

1060
01:14:42.107 --> 01:14:44.026
Palmer, no! What are you doing?

1061
01:14:44.109 --> 01:14:45.152
Stop!

1062
01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:47.654
-Eddie!
-Palmer!

1063
01:14:47.738 --> 01:14:49.615
-Palmer!
-Eddie! Hey!

1064
01:14:49.698 --> 01:14:51.867
-Get off me!
-Eddie, Eddie.

1065
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:53.785
What the hell you doing? My--

1066
01:14:53.869 --> 01:14:55.996
-Simmer down, man!
-Palmer. Palmer--

1067
01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.332
Funny to you too, Coles, huh?

1068
01:14:58.415 --> 01:15:01.752
Seeing a grown man hold a little boy down,
make him cry while he put makeup on him?

1069
01:15:01.835 --> 01:15:04.213
-I was not-- I wasn't there--
-The fuck you weren't!

1070
01:15:04.296 --> 01:15:06.673
-It was at your fucking house.
-I wasn't there.

1071
01:15:08.383 --> 01:15:09.968
Let's get one thing straight.

1072
01:15:10.928 --> 01:15:15.516
Your daddy comes to see me,
you ain't walkin' away this time.

1073
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:18.268
Believe me on that.

1074
01:15:19.895 --> 01:15:21.313
Twelve fucking years!

1075
01:15:33.116 --> 01:15:34.743
What's everybody lookin' at? Show's over.

1076
01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:36.370
-Fuck.
-Come on. Let's go.

1077
01:15:36.453 --> 01:15:37.955
-Get up.
-Oh, my God, Daryl.

1078
01:15:38.038 --> 01:15:39.206
Come on.

1079
01:15:40.249 --> 01:15:42.876
-Is he okay?
-Jesus H. Christ.

1080
01:15:53.637 --> 01:15:54.805
What are you gonna do?

1081
01:15:56.181 --> 01:15:57.724
Beat up everyone that picks on him?

1082
01:15:58.642 --> 01:16:00.686
No, just the ones over 30.

1083
01:16:00.769 --> 01:16:03.522
There are other ways to handle things.

1084
01:16:06.108 --> 01:16:09.152
-Are you gonna get in trouble?
-Daryl ain't gonna press charges.

1085
01:16:10.153 --> 01:16:11.196
Lucky you.

1086
01:16:14.199 --> 01:16:15.701
Sam cried himself to sleep...

1087
01:16:16.618 --> 01:16:17.828
asking for you.

1088
01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:28.839
Hey, I--

1089
01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:55.365
I got you this.

1090
01:17:06.168 --> 01:17:08.170
Sam. Listen to me.

1091
01:17:09.588 --> 01:17:12.257
What Daryl did to you was wrong.

1092
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:14.676
You know that, right?

1093
01:17:15.844 --> 01:17:17.638
You didn't do anything bad.

1094
01:17:18.764 --> 01:17:19.806
You understand me?

1095
01:17:20.349 --> 01:17:22.518
-Okay.
-Not a thing.

1096
01:17:23.977 --> 01:17:25.020
You hear me, son?

1097
01:17:25.812 --> 01:17:26.813
Yeah.

1098
01:17:27.564 --> 01:17:28.565
Okay.

1099
01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:32.236
Hey. I got an idea.

1100
01:17:32.945 --> 01:17:33.946
Come on.

1101
01:17:35.364 --> 01:17:37.783
All right. Here's what we got so far.

1102
01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:41.161
"Dear Penelope's Flying Princess Club"--

1103
01:17:41.828 --> 01:17:43.914
-Did I get that right?
-Yeah.

1104
01:17:43.997 --> 01:17:47.793
"My name is Sam, and I would very much
like to be a member."

1105
01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:52.130
Make sure you tell them how much I love
their show, and I watch it every day.

1106
01:17:52.214 --> 01:17:57.427
"I watch your show, and...

1107
01:17:59.137 --> 01:18:01.014
I love it

1108
01:18:01.098 --> 01:18:06.311
more than anything in the world."

1109
01:18:07.771 --> 01:18:08.772
All right.

1110
01:18:08.856 --> 01:18:10.858
All you gotta do
is sign your name right there.

1111
01:18:16.822 --> 01:18:18.448
Should be good to go.

1112
01:18:32.254 --> 01:18:33.463
Hey, Sammy.

1113
01:18:35.966 --> 01:18:37.759
Hi, baby.

1114
01:18:40.596 --> 01:18:43.307
Aren't you gonna come give
your mama a hug? Come on.

1115
01:18:43.849 --> 01:18:44.933
Hey, Mama.

1116
01:18:47.311 --> 01:18:50.147
Oh, boy. I missed you so much.

1117
01:18:51.481 --> 01:18:54.526
Look at you. Hi.

1118
01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:57.070
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1119
01:18:57.154 --> 01:18:58.405
Yeah, I'm good.

1120
01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:03.285
I heard about Miss Vivian.

1121
01:19:04.203 --> 01:19:05.746
I'm sorry about that.

1122
01:19:07.915 --> 01:19:09.750
She was a good woman. I liked her.

1123
01:19:12.753 --> 01:19:15.172
Sammy, I think it's time for us
to go home, baby.

1124
01:19:15.255 --> 01:19:16.673
You wanna go get your stuff?

1125
01:19:17.466 --> 01:19:19.593
-Back home?
-Yeah.

1126
01:19:26.016 --> 01:19:28.393
-Don't forget this.
-I won't.

1127
01:19:30.896 --> 01:19:31.939
Hey.

1128
01:19:32.981 --> 01:19:34.149
We had a good time.

1129
01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:38.737
And you can come and visit me
whenever you like.

1130
01:19:48.872 --> 01:19:49.873
All right.

1131
01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:52.626
I'll go get the rest of your stuff.

1132
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:53.836
Thanks, Palmer.

1133
01:19:55.504 --> 01:19:56.588
Where'd you get that?

1134
01:19:57.256 --> 01:19:58.382
That ain't yours.

1135
01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.135
Palmer got it for me for my birthday.

1136
01:20:03.303 --> 01:20:04.888
Hey. Guess what?

1137
01:20:06.056 --> 01:20:08.684
I got you the best present ever.

1138
01:20:09.268 --> 01:20:10.811
Greatest thing in the world.

1139
01:20:11.395 --> 01:20:15.357
And I had to travel so far to get it.
Far and wide.

1140
01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.192
And I chased the rainbow for you.

1141
01:20:18.485 --> 01:20:19.945
-Really?
-Yeah.

1142
01:20:20.028 --> 01:20:21.363
And it's pretty.

1143
01:20:22.656 --> 01:20:24.032
I'm excited to give it to you.

1144
01:20:24.116 --> 01:20:25.325
All right, kiddo.

1145
01:20:25.701 --> 01:20:29.746
Wow. You really moved in here, huh?

1146
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:32.499
-Well, you were gone a while.
-Yeah.

1147
01:20:34.084 --> 01:20:35.169
Come on. Let's go.

1148
01:20:37.796 --> 01:20:40.507
Sam, I said it's time to go. Come on.

1149
01:20:41.633 --> 01:20:42.634
Go on.

1150
01:20:43.677 --> 01:20:47.014
Thanks for watching him for me.
Let's go get your present. Come on.

1151
01:20:47.097 --> 01:20:48.515
Let's go home.

1152
01:20:48.599 --> 01:20:50.267
I wanna take a bath.

1153
01:21:45.405 --> 01:21:46.615
Hey, is Sam okay?

1154
01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:49.910
Shelly came back.

1155
01:21:51.286 --> 01:21:52.371
She did?

1156
01:21:54.456 --> 01:21:56.208
Didn't look too good either.

1157
01:21:57.167 --> 01:21:58.919
Kinda sickly, you know?

1158
01:21:59.962 --> 01:22:01.880
I'm sure he'll be back tomorrow.

1159
01:22:02.506 --> 01:22:03.674
I hope so.

1160
01:22:07.678 --> 01:22:09.096
-Hey--
-I'm gonna--

1161
01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:11.640
-I'm gonna get back--
-Yeah, no. I'll let you get back.

1162
01:22:38.584 --> 01:22:39.585
Hey.

1163
01:22:40.711 --> 01:22:41.879
Where's your lunch box?

1164
01:22:43.589 --> 01:22:44.923
Jerry threw it away.

1165
01:22:47.009 --> 01:22:49.887
Did he? What'd he do that for?

1166
01:22:50.804 --> 01:22:53.765
He said my mama
was raising me to be a queer,

1167
01:22:53.849 --> 01:22:56.393
and he ain't living with no queer kid.

1168
01:22:59.563 --> 01:23:00.981
What does queer mean?

1169
01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:05.485
Well, some people
think it means you're different.

1170
01:23:06.528 --> 01:23:07.696
Are you queer?

1171
01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:10.991
Well, I'm different. That's for sure.

1172
01:23:14.578 --> 01:23:15.579
Hey.

1173
01:23:16.288 --> 01:23:17.873
You know what else we are?

1174
01:23:19.666 --> 01:23:20.834
Good-looking.

1175
01:23:22.377 --> 01:23:25.214
No, don't laugh.
We're both good-looking fellas.

1176
01:23:25.297 --> 01:23:27.549
It intimidates people. Makes 'em afraid.

1177
01:23:29.968 --> 01:23:32.179
Plus you can never trust a guy
with a mullet.

1178
01:23:32.888 --> 01:23:34.223
What's a mullet?

1179
01:23:34.306 --> 01:23:37.309
It's creepy is what it is.
Come on, I'll give you a ride to school.

1180
01:23:37.935 --> 01:23:39.019
Thanks, Palmer.

1181
01:23:39.603 --> 01:23:42.314
Hey, how about after school
I take you to get a root beer float?

1182
01:23:42.397 --> 01:23:44.983
I can't. I gotta help my mama.

1183
01:23:45.442 --> 01:23:48.237
-Why?
-'Cause we're moving to Jerry's.

1184
01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.739
And I'm gonna have to go
to another school.

1185
01:23:53.283 --> 01:23:55.953
I guess I'll just have to visit you then.

1186
01:23:56.036 --> 01:23:57.037
Promise?

1187
01:23:57.955 --> 01:23:59.373
You got my word, kiddo.

1188
01:24:19.935 --> 01:24:23.605
Let's go. Come on. Christ.
Like mother like daughter. You two.

1189
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:24.773
Yeah.

1190
01:24:25.691 --> 01:24:27.734
I love the commentary.

1191
01:24:27.818 --> 01:24:30.195
You always rush me. Don't rush me!

1192
01:24:58.974 --> 01:25:00.851
...you fucking touch me!

1193
01:25:00.934 --> 01:25:02.186
Get away from me!

1194
01:25:02.269 --> 01:25:04.813
Just calm the fuck down,
all right. This ain't my goddamn fault.

1195
01:25:04.897 --> 01:25:07.649
-Get the fuck away from me.
-Just going up here, just listening.

1196
01:25:07.733 --> 01:25:09.193
-Hey.
-Ain't like it's the first time.

1197
01:25:09.276 --> 01:25:10.777
Hey.

1198
01:25:10.861 --> 01:25:11.862
What was that?

1199
01:25:13.405 --> 01:25:15.365
What the fuck is going on? Where's Sam?

1200
01:25:17.534 --> 01:25:20.204
-Where is he?
-He's gone. He ain't here.

1201
01:25:23.373 --> 01:25:27.628
The fucking police.
The CPS, they took him away.

1202
01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:36.929
Mother of the fucking year you are.

1203
01:25:41.058 --> 01:25:44.603
There's a case hearing with
his mother in family court on Monday.

1204
01:25:44.686 --> 01:25:47.606
The judge will decide then
if Sam is placed into a home

1205
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:49.274
or returned to his mother.

1206
01:25:50.651 --> 01:25:54.655
Normally, we try to find relatives
for temporary custody.

1207
01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:56.532
I'll need you to fill out this paperwork.

1208
01:25:57.908 --> 01:25:59.785
I have a felony record.

1209
01:26:00.536 --> 01:26:02.204
Are you currently on parole?

1210
01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:07.960
I'm sorry. The agency won't approve
a foster care license if you're on parole.

1211
01:26:11.004 --> 01:26:12.005
Can I see him?

1212
01:26:12.089 --> 01:26:14.258
-No.
-He's probably scared, ma'am.

1213
01:26:14.341 --> 01:26:16.885
-If he could just see a friendly face--
-Sir, I understand.

1214
01:26:16.969 --> 01:26:20.848
But not unless you're a parent,
a family member, or a legal guardian.

1215
01:26:23.058 --> 01:26:25.602
It's possible
the judge could make an exception.

1216
01:26:26.103 --> 01:26:27.771
It's unlikely.

1217
01:26:32.818 --> 01:26:33.986
What do you want?

1218
01:26:35.529 --> 01:26:36.655
Where's Jerry?

1219
01:26:38.156 --> 01:26:39.658
I don't know. You tell me.

1220
01:26:41.201 --> 01:26:44.079
Hey, you got a cigarette for me?

1221
01:26:49.751 --> 01:26:50.752
Thank you.

1222
01:27:00.304 --> 01:27:01.805
Why are you here, huh?

1223
01:27:06.226 --> 01:27:07.352
What's this?

1224
01:27:16.195 --> 01:27:17.821
A legal guardian?

1225
01:27:18.405 --> 01:27:20.532
You'd be signing Sam over to my care.

1226
01:27:23.785 --> 01:27:25.287
Why the fuck would I do that?

1227
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:28.665
Because unless you get clean, I don't see
the courts giving him back to you.

1228
01:27:30.167 --> 01:27:32.002
I need you to get outta my house.

1229
01:27:32.628 --> 01:27:33.754
Take it.

1230
01:27:45.349 --> 01:27:47.559
You think you can buy my son?

1231
01:27:47.643 --> 01:27:48.852
No.

1232
01:27:50.771 --> 01:27:53.106
-You think that you're better than me?
-No.

1233
01:27:53.190 --> 01:27:54.399
I think you do.

1234
01:27:55.234 --> 01:27:57.569
You think just 'cause you fucked me...

1235
01:27:58.779 --> 01:28:00.322
that you're his daddy?

1236
01:28:03.116 --> 01:28:04.660
You ain't his fucking daddy.

1237
01:28:05.285 --> 01:28:07.246
And you ain't fucking better
than me neither.

1238
01:28:07.329 --> 01:28:09.540
-And I don't want your money.
-I don't think I'm better than you.

1239
01:28:09.623 --> 01:28:12.042
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey, I don't think I'm better than you.

1240
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:15.170
Hell, maybe a little bit luckier
this time around.

1241
01:28:15.254 --> 01:28:17.297
But if something were to happen to you...

1242
01:28:18.507 --> 01:28:21.176
they will take Sam
and put him wherever they want.

1243
01:28:22.386 --> 01:28:23.762
-No.
-And you and I both know...

1244
01:28:23.846 --> 01:28:26.557
-No.
-...he ain't like other boys.

1245
01:28:27.474 --> 01:28:29.643
They are gonna give Sammy back to me.

1246
01:28:31.228 --> 01:28:34.189
Sammy and I, we're gonna be fine. Okay?

1247
01:28:34.273 --> 01:28:38.735
We're gonna leave this shit town
behind us, and I'm gonna get clean.

1248
01:28:38.819 --> 01:28:40.821
I'm gonna do it, you know?

1249
01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:44.157
Hey! I'm gonna buy us a big house.

1250
01:28:44.616 --> 01:28:48.662
I'm gonna show you, and you will see
that I can do it.

1251
01:28:48.745 --> 01:28:49.913
I can--

1252
01:28:50.706 --> 01:28:52.791
-Please take the money.
-No.

1253
01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:55.711
-Shelly, listen to me.
-Don't look at me like that.

1254
01:28:55.794 --> 01:28:57.045
-Please.
-No.

1255
01:28:57.129 --> 01:28:58.505
Don't look at me like that.

1256
01:28:59.006 --> 01:29:00.591
Don't look at me!

1257
01:29:02.718 --> 01:29:03.802
Get outta my house.

1258
01:29:05.762 --> 01:29:07.181
Get outta my house!

1259
01:29:09.516 --> 01:29:12.519
Get the fuck out of my house!

1260
01:29:29.411 --> 01:29:31.496
I'm sorry to just show up like this.

1261
01:29:40.714 --> 01:29:42.716
Mr. Palmer, come with me.

1262
01:29:50.516 --> 01:29:55.312
Mr. Palmer, you appear to be moving
in the right direction, doing well.

1263
01:29:55.896 --> 01:29:59.816
And perhaps, once you get
your living situation squared away

1264
01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.944
and are no longer on parole...

1265
01:30:03.028 --> 01:30:05.197
you can apply for the license again.

1266
01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.281
Please.

1267
01:30:07.115 --> 01:30:09.117
I did what I did when I was younger,

1268
01:30:09.868 --> 01:30:12.788
and I got what I got,
so I ain't blaming nobody, Your Honor.

1269
01:30:13.622 --> 01:30:19.837
But truth is, I haven't felt like
I was good at anything in a long time...

1270
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:21.630
until Sam.

1271
01:30:24.216 --> 01:30:28.512
My decision is that the boy
will remain under the care of the state.

1272
01:30:28.595 --> 01:30:30.722
He will be placed
in a registered foster home

1273
01:30:30.806 --> 01:30:34.184
until the mother is well enough
to regain custody.

1274
01:30:34.268 --> 01:30:36.770
Your Honor, she's a drug addict.
That ain't gonna happen.

1275
01:30:36.854 --> 01:30:38.230
But, for now, I'm sorry.

1276
01:30:38.313 --> 01:30:41.275
I have to deny your request
for temporary custody.

1277
01:30:41.358 --> 01:30:42.776
Don't do this.

1278
01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:45.863
I know what it feels like
to be left alone.

1279
01:30:47.322 --> 01:30:48.615
I can't abandon that boy.

1280
01:30:48.699 --> 01:30:50.868
I will not abandon that boy.

1281
01:30:53.453 --> 01:30:54.663
I promise you...

1282
01:30:55.789 --> 01:30:57.875
nobody would ever have to worry
about Sam again.

1283
01:30:57.958 --> 01:30:59.668
I'd take real good care of him.

1284
01:31:00.752 --> 01:31:02.004
Real good care.

1285
01:31:03.255 --> 01:31:05.257
I'm sorry. That's my decision.

1286
01:31:11.722 --> 01:31:12.806
Excuse me, ma'am.

1287
01:31:12.890 --> 01:31:15.475
-I'm supposed to be there. Hey! I'm here.
-You can't go in there.

1288
01:31:15.559 --> 01:31:18.395
Sir, get your hands off me. I'm here.

1289
01:31:18.478 --> 01:31:20.981
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-I'm sorry, Your Honor.

1290
01:31:21.064 --> 01:31:23.192
-What is he doing here?
-Excuse me.

1291
01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:24.443
I am Sam's mother.

1292
01:31:24.526 --> 01:31:27.446
-Please do not approach the bench.
-Ma'am-- Sorry, ma'am, no.

1293
01:31:29.364 --> 01:31:32.242
Your Honor, I'm sorry I'm late.
But I'm here.

1294
01:31:33.202 --> 01:31:36.747
Ma'am, them police,
they didn't even talk to Sam, okay?

1295
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:39.333
They just came into my house,
and they took my boy away.

1296
01:31:39.416 --> 01:31:40.918
And they didn't even say why.

1297
01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:44.963
Miss Burdette, a complaint of abuse
and neglect has been made

1298
01:31:45.047 --> 01:31:46.673
to Child Protective Services.

1299
01:31:46.757 --> 01:31:50.010
And you were described
as being violent and agitated.

1300
01:31:50.093 --> 01:31:52.513
That ain't true. Ma'am, no.

1301
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:58.393
Agitated, yes. I was agitated.
I'll admit to that.

1302
01:31:59.478 --> 01:32:01.897
I've had some health problems recently.

1303
01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:04.066
I ain't trying to deny that.

1304
01:32:05.192 --> 01:32:09.071
Listen, I don't know what your notes say,
or what he said, or anyone else.

1305
01:32:09.571 --> 01:32:12.074
But I ain't never laid a hand on my boy.

1306
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:15.202
I ain't never even
raised my voice to Sammy.

1307
01:32:15.285 --> 01:32:16.745
Ma'am, he ain't an unhappy boy.

1308
01:32:16.828 --> 01:32:18.956
-Miss Burdette, I understand.
-I'll do whatever you want.

1309
01:32:19.039 --> 01:32:21.583
What? You wanna piss-test me?
Then fine. Test me.

1310
01:32:23.168 --> 01:32:24.545
I beg you.

1311
01:32:24.628 --> 01:32:27.381
Please don't send my little boy
to go live with no strangers.

1312
01:32:31.134 --> 01:32:32.678
He needs to be with his mama.

1313
01:32:34.221 --> 01:32:35.347
Please.

1314
01:33:08.922 --> 01:33:10.215
You good?

1315
01:33:10.924 --> 01:33:11.925
Sam?

1316
01:33:12.634 --> 01:33:14.845
Hey, Sammy. Come on, baby.

1317
01:33:15.888 --> 01:33:18.765
Hey. More to put in the car. Come on.

1318
01:33:25.272 --> 01:33:27.649
I am fucking tired
of your fucking bullshit!

1319
01:33:27.733 --> 01:33:29.193
Goddamn it! You again?

1320
01:33:29.276 --> 01:33:32.404
How many fucking times do I gotta tell you
to stop all these fucking things?

1321
01:33:32.487 --> 01:33:34.823
I am so tired of you!

1322
01:33:34.907 --> 01:33:37.201
I'm gonna burn down this fucking trailer.

1323
01:33:37.284 --> 01:33:40.621
And you and that half a fag kid
are gonna be out on the goddamn streets.

1324
01:33:40.704 --> 01:33:42.497
He's gonna be sucking dick by Christmas.

1325
01:33:42.581 --> 01:33:44.625
I am fucking tired
of your fucking bullshit.

1326
01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:51.006
You lying fucking whore!
Go ahead. Fucking say it.

1327
01:33:51.089 --> 01:33:53.717
-What the fuck is wrong with you anyway?
-Mama!

1328
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.260
Get off of my mama!

1329
01:33:55.344 --> 01:33:56.512
-Get off of me!
-Mama!

1330
01:33:56.595 --> 01:33:58.931
-Get this goddamn kid off of me. Go!
-Don't hurt my baby, please!

1331
01:33:59.014 --> 01:34:00.724
-Get off me, you little shit!
-Please!

1332
01:34:00.807 --> 01:34:02.434
Is that what you want?
Let me tell you where I'm gonna put your--

1333
01:34:02.518 --> 01:34:04.311
-No! Hey!
-What?

1334
01:34:05.729 --> 01:34:07.523
Oh, my God.

1335
01:34:07.606 --> 01:34:09.525
You just made Jerry fly.

1336
01:34:10.067 --> 01:34:11.860
He just fucking flew.

1337
01:34:12.694 --> 01:34:14.988
I ain't never seen him do that before.

1338
01:34:17.032 --> 01:34:19.409
-Come on, Sam. Come on.
-He flew!

1339
01:34:19.952 --> 01:34:20.953
Hey.

1340
01:34:21.745 --> 01:34:23.705
Hey! Where are you going with my boy?

1341
01:34:24.206 --> 01:34:26.375
Hey! Son of a bitch!

1342
01:34:36.385 --> 01:34:39.346
Hey. It's gonna be all right. Okay?

1343
01:34:39.972 --> 01:34:41.223
-Okay.
-All right?

1344
01:34:41.306 --> 01:34:42.307
All right.

1345
01:35:00.492 --> 01:35:02.077
Stay here, Sam, okay?

1346
01:35:06.832 --> 01:35:08.500
You got a phone I can use?

1347
01:35:09.376 --> 01:35:10.377
Thank you.

1348
01:35:18.635 --> 01:35:19.636
Hello?

1349
01:35:20.053 --> 01:35:21.096
It's me.

1350
01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.016
-I took Sam.
-Jesus Christ.

1351
01:35:24.099 --> 01:35:26.560
Eddie, Shelly called the police.
They're looking for you.

1352
01:35:27.686 --> 01:35:28.937
You gotta bring him back.

1353
01:35:29.021 --> 01:35:30.856
I can't. Not to that.

1354
01:35:30.939 --> 01:35:33.192
-Eddie, it's kidnapping.
-She ain't fit.

1355
01:35:33.275 --> 01:35:36.028
Maybe so, but where you gonna go?

1356
01:35:36.778 --> 01:35:39.281
You wanna go back to prison?
Is that what you want?

1357
01:35:40.782 --> 01:35:43.368
She's Sam's mother, Eddie.

1358
01:35:44.328 --> 01:35:47.956
Good or bad, right or wrong,
she's Sam's mother.

1359
01:35:58.634 --> 01:35:59.718
Call Coles.

1360
01:36:10.103 --> 01:36:11.355
What are we gonna do?

1361
01:36:36.004 --> 01:36:38.549
Everything's gonna be okay. All right?

1362
01:36:43.887 --> 01:36:45.305
There's my boy! Sammy!

1363
01:36:45.389 --> 01:36:48.100
-Get back.
-No! Hey. Sammy!

1364
01:36:48.183 --> 01:36:49.393
-Oh, my God.
-Hey, hey.

1365
01:36:49.476 --> 01:36:51.728
You fucking let go of me! Oh, my God. No!

1366
01:36:51.812 --> 01:36:52.896
Hold her.

1367
01:36:53.647 --> 01:36:57.150
-We gotta get out now. Come on.
-Sammy! Baby!

1368
01:36:57.234 --> 01:36:59.862
-Hold her. Steady.
-Sammy! Sammy!

1369
01:36:59.945 --> 01:37:02.281
-I'm gonna take you to court.
-Calm down.

1370
01:37:02.364 --> 01:37:03.949
Get her on the ground and keep her there.

1371
01:37:04.032 --> 01:37:05.200
-Shit.
-Sammy.

1372
01:37:05.284 --> 01:37:08.245
-I'm calm! Sammy, come to Mama.
-Look. She ain't in any shape.

1373
01:37:08.328 --> 01:37:10.747
-Out of her goddamn mind.
-Please, baby, come here.

1374
01:37:10.831 --> 01:37:12.249
Yeah.

1375
01:37:12.332 --> 01:37:14.543
I'm gonna take Sammy to Maggie's.
He'll stay there for now.

1376
01:37:14.626 --> 01:37:16.128
-My baby.
-All right?

1377
01:37:16.211 --> 01:37:18.797
I love you. Hi. Are you okay?

1378
01:37:18.881 --> 01:37:21.842
Did he hurt you? So worried about you.

1379
01:37:21.925 --> 01:37:23.844
-I'm so sorry. Truly.
-Turn around, Eddie.

1380
01:37:23.927 --> 01:37:25.220
Tell me you're okay.

1381
01:37:25.971 --> 01:37:27.389
Put your hands behind your back.

1382
01:37:28.473 --> 01:37:30.809
You just couldn't stay outta trouble,
could ya?

1383
01:37:31.977 --> 01:37:33.770
-Mama was so worried about you.
-Let's go.

1384
01:37:33.854 --> 01:37:36.231
Hey, baby. My precious boy.

1385
01:37:36.315 --> 01:37:38.192
Don't you let him go back into the system.

1386
01:37:38.275 --> 01:37:40.068
-It's okay.
-No!

1387
01:37:40.152 --> 01:37:41.737
No, Sammy, Sammy, no.

1388
01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:44.781
-Let him go!
-Hey, hey. Come on, Sammy.

1389
01:37:44.865 --> 01:37:46.658
-Stop. Hey. I said stop it.
-You get your fucking hands off my boy!

1390
01:37:46.742 --> 01:37:48.410
-Knew they let you out too soon.
-You're hurting him.

1391
01:37:48.493 --> 01:37:50.120
-Come on, Sammy.
-No, baby!

1392
01:37:50.204 --> 01:37:52.706
-Let him go!
-Sammy.

1393
01:37:53.332 --> 01:37:54.917
Hey, baby. I love you.

1394
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.294
I got you. Your mama loves you.
I'm gonna take care of you.

1395
01:37:57.377 --> 01:37:59.838
-You never take care of me!
-I love you. Yes, I do.

1396
01:37:59.922 --> 01:38:02.674
-You never do!
-I do. I do. I got you, honey.

1397
01:38:02.758 --> 01:38:04.593
Let me go!

1398
01:38:06.345 --> 01:38:07.804
Palmer!

1399
01:38:10.349 --> 01:38:11.892
Palmer!

1400
01:38:12.935 --> 01:38:14.311
Go to your mama, Sam.

1401
01:38:15.062 --> 01:38:17.105
Palmer!

1402
01:38:18.607 --> 01:38:20.442
-It's okay.
-Palmer.

1403
01:38:21.026 --> 01:38:22.027
Sam.

1404
01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:23.612
Palmer!

1405
01:38:24.196 --> 01:38:25.572
Palmer!

1406
01:38:27.366 --> 01:38:28.617
Palmer!

1407
01:38:30.285 --> 01:38:31.703
Palmer!

1408
01:38:32.621 --> 01:38:34.831
Palmer!

1409
01:38:35.749 --> 01:38:37.292
Palmer!

1410
01:39:19.918 --> 01:39:21.253
You're free to go.

1411
01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:27.050
Shelly said you were just taking Sam
to get something to eat.

1412
01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:31.471
Too high to remember, I guess.

1413
01:39:32.764 --> 01:39:34.850
So we gotta drop the charges.

1414
01:39:36.351 --> 01:39:38.145
Sam's still at Maggie's.

1415
01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:48.071
Hey.

1416
01:39:50.616 --> 01:39:51.700
I owed you one.

1417
01:39:53.243 --> 01:39:55.412
Yeah. You did.

1418
01:40:22.022 --> 01:40:23.607
You think I'm a terrible mother.

1419
01:40:36.495 --> 01:40:37.496
Hey, Sammy.

1420
01:40:45.212 --> 01:40:46.213
Hi, baby.

1421
01:41:01.770 --> 01:41:02.771
Hey.

1422
01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:09.528
I know you're mad at me.

1423
01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.281
It's okay.

1424
01:41:13.907 --> 01:41:15.409
I'd be mad at me too.

1425
01:41:18.036 --> 01:41:22.291
Well, I need to talk to you
about something real important.

1426
01:41:24.251 --> 01:41:25.961
Do you think we could do that?

1427
01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.423
Yeah, I can sit here with you?

1428
01:41:29.506 --> 01:41:30.549
Yeah, Mama.

1429
01:41:31.884 --> 01:41:32.885
Thank you.

1430
01:41:43.896 --> 01:41:46.231
I've been doing some thinking
about some things.

1431
01:41:50.485 --> 01:41:53.280
I think it would be best
if you live with Palmer.

1432
01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:57.868
He's a good man.

1433
01:41:58.911 --> 01:42:00.829
And he cares about you so much.

1434
01:42:03.582 --> 01:42:04.583
And...

1435
01:42:13.592 --> 01:42:15.969
I'm struggling.

1436
01:42:17.346 --> 01:42:20.098
Baby, I'm really struggling now.

1437
01:42:25.521 --> 01:42:26.605
But--

1438
01:42:26.688 --> 01:42:28.440
Give me your hands.

1439
01:42:30.692 --> 01:42:32.694
It isn't because I don't love you.

1440
01:42:36.365 --> 01:42:38.408
I love you with all my heart.

1441
01:42:43.914 --> 01:42:45.207
What do you think?

1442
01:42:50.796 --> 01:42:52.464
You wanna live with Palmer?

1443
01:42:54.299 --> 01:42:56.051
You want him to be your daddy?

1444
01:42:56.134 --> 01:42:58.387
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1445
01:43:04.518 --> 01:43:06.520
Come here and give me a hug.

1446
01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:21.577
All right.

1447
01:43:45.309 --> 01:43:46.643
Got everything you need?

1448
01:43:46.727 --> 01:43:48.270
Looks like it.

1449
01:43:48.353 --> 01:43:51.190
Are we gonna have dinner tonight
with Miss Maggie?

1450
01:43:51.273 --> 01:43:53.942
Yep. She's cooking
your favorite, broccoli.

1451
01:43:54.026 --> 01:43:55.277
Broccoli?

1452
01:43:58.071 --> 01:44:00.741
Forbes's air conditioner is fixed.
I'll get it over to him.

1453
01:44:02.451 --> 01:44:03.452
Palmer.

1454
01:44:05.454 --> 01:44:06.663
I have something for you.

1455
01:44:17.466 --> 01:44:18.675
Your keys.

1456
01:44:20.302 --> 01:44:22.012
I think you've earned these.

1457
01:44:27.976 --> 01:44:29.102
Thank you, Sibs.

1458
01:44:31.021 --> 01:44:33.440
Well, Junior don't like to wait.
Get on outta here.

1459
01:44:40.572 --> 01:44:42.741
-Bye, Sam.
-Bye, Emily.

1460
01:44:43.617 --> 01:44:45.077
Hey, when's our next tea party?

1461
01:44:45.619 --> 01:44:47.454
I don't know. You tell me.

1462
01:44:48.747 --> 01:44:50.249
I don't know the schedule.

1463
01:44:56.713 --> 01:44:58.924
Come on. We gotta go pick something up.

1464
01:45:21.196 --> 01:45:23.407
Hey, Sam? Come here.

1465
01:45:27.911 --> 01:45:28.912
It's for you.

1466
01:45:32.583 --> 01:45:34.501
I've never got mail before.

1467
01:45:34.585 --> 01:45:36.128
Open it. See what it says.

1468
01:45:53.770 --> 01:45:55.606
Look at it. There's a golden star.

1469
01:45:55.689 --> 01:45:58.317
And look at my name. It's right here.
Sam Burdette, and--

1470
01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:00.319
Yeah. Yeah.

1471
01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:05.949
Hey.

1472
01:46:06.033 --> 01:46:07.159
Congratulations.
